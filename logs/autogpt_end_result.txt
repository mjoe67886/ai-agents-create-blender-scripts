FOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST

START OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS

Do not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:

DEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS

1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.

2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:
# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.
bpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)

# Add the sphere to the collection
my_collection.objects.link(sphere)

3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.

4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.

5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.
Avoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.
Additionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.

6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.

7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.

8. Provides full code with no placeholders.

9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.
It will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.

For example, don't do this:
if bpy.context.object is None:
    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))

Instead, do this:
if not bpy.context.selected_objects:
    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))

10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,
create the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.
This ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.

11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.
Try to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.
Avoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,
within the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.
Ensure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\n) to improve readability in the console.
For example: `print("\nError: Object not found")`

12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.
Always use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:
`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.
If you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:
`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.

13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.

14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.

15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.

16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.

15. For procedural materials, connect the Emission shader to 'Surface' on Material Output. Ensure Transparent BSDF connects only to shader inputs for accurate effects.

16. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.

21. Always use the `frame` keyword instead of `index` when inserting keyframes.
Example: leg_bones[bone].keyframe_insert(data_path='rotation_euler', frame=frame)

25. If you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea. Because while `context.active_object` will show the currently active object, if you deselect all objects, it will still show the last active object:

# What NOT to do:
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))
grid = bpy.context.object

# What TO do:
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))
def get_active_object(context):
    selected_objects = context.selected_objects
    if selected_objects:
        return context.active_object
    return None

26. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what,as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.

27. If calling `bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add` results in `RuntimeError: Operator bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add.poll() failed, context is incorrect`, ensure the correct `VIEW_3D` area and `WINDOW` region are set up before calling it.

Just use `bpy.context.temp_override(area=area, region=region)` before running the operator.
Example:
```python
import bpy
image_path = "C:\\Users\\image_file_name.png"

for area in bpy.context.screen.areas:
    if area.type == "VIEW_3D":
        for region in area.regions:
            if region.type == "WINDOW":
                with bpy.context.temp_override(area=area, region=region):
                    bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add(filepath=image_path, relative_path=False, rotation=(1.31121, -2.81228e-07, 1.50394), background=True)
                break
        break

28. If you encounter `AttributeError: 'GeometryNodeObjectInfo' object has no attribute 'properties'`, do not attempt to assign an object using `object_info.properties.object`. In Blender 4.3, the correct method to set the object for an Object Info node is:

# Correct way to assign the instance object:
object_info.inputs[0].default_value = instance_object

# Do NOT use both of the following lines together:
object_info.inputs[0].default_value = instance_object  # ✅ Correct
object_info.properties.object = instance_object  # ❌ Incorrect (causes an AttributeError)

Using both lines together is redundant and incorrect. Only set `inputs[0].default_value` to define the object.

By breaking down the tasks into functions and using context overrides, I can ensure the script is organized and adheres to Blender's best practices. Error handling will help manage any issues that arise during execution.

PLAN:
- Create a plane at the origin
- Apply an emission shader with customizable properties
- Add a boolean modifier
- Generate and unwrap a UV map
- Create a UI panel with radio buttons
- Implement geometry nodes for dynamic grass
- Set up studio lighting
- Animate the emission shader
- Integrate a camera rig
- Optimize render settings

CRITICISM:
I need to ensure that each function is thoroughly tested and that the script is robust against potential errors. The script should be user-friendly and not require additional input from the user.

==========================
BLENDER INSTRUCTION LOOKUP
==========================

Hey GPT Assistant, it looks like you got an error.

Here are some proven Python practices that are known to work for this type of error.

Make sure to apply any and all relevant instructions to your fix.

If ever get conflicting instructions, use these instructions first, these are all tested.


1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.

5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.
Avoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.
Additionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.

9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.
It will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.

For example, don't do this:
if bpy.context.object is None:
    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))

Instead, do this:
if not bpy.context.selected_objects:
    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))

10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,
create the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.
This ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.

11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.
Try to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.
Avoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops.
Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable, within the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.
Ensure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\n) to improve readability in the console.
For example: `print("\nError: Object not found")`

=====================
BLENDER MANUAL LOOKUP
=====================

We looked up the error in the Blender 4.3 MANUAL for you:

The error message you encountered indicates that the Boolean modifier's target object cannot be set to itself. This is a restriction in Blender to prevent circular references. The relevant section from the Blender Manual regarding the Boolean modifier is as follows:

---

### Boolean Modifier

The Boolean modifier allows you to perform operations on meshes using other meshes as operands. The operations available are:

- **Intersect**: Keeps everything inside both the target mesh and the modified mesh.
- **Union**: Adds the target mesh or collection to the modified mesh, removing any interior faces.
- **Difference**: Subtracts the target mesh from the modified mesh, keeping everything outside of the target mesh.

#### Operand Type
- **Object**: The target is a mesh object.
- **Collection**: The target is a collection. When the target is a collection and the Solver is Fast, the Intersect operation is not allowed.

#### Object
- The name of the target mesh object. **Note**: The target object cannot be the same as the object to which the modifier is applied.

#### Solver
- **Fast**: Uses a mathematically simple solver which offers the best performance; however, this solver lacks support for overlapping geometry.
- **Exact**: Uses a mathematically complex solver which offers the best results and has full support for overlapping geometry; however, this solver is much slower than the Fast Solver.

#### Solver Options
- **Self Intersection**: Correctly calculates cases when one or both operands have self-intersections, which involves more calculations making it slower.

---

For more details, you can refer to the Blender Manual【4:17†source】.

Use this knowledge to familiarize yourself with the proper functions, operators, types, classes, etcetera used in Blender 4.3, while making sure to output a full script, as requested, by the user in the 'ORIGINAL REQUEST' above.

TEXT:
The error indicates that the Boolean modifier's target object cannot be set to itself. I need to ensure that the target object for the Boolean modifier is different from the plane. Additionally, I will incorporate the trusted file paths provided by the user.

REASONING:
By ensuring the target object is different from the plane, I can avoid the circular reference error. I will also ensure that the script is modular and includes error handling.

PLAN:
- Fix the Boolean modifier error by ensuring the target object is different from the plane
- Incorporate the trusted file paths
- Ensure the script is modular and includes error handling
