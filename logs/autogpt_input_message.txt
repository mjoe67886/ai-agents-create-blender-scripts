Create a Blender script that will accomplish the following tasks:

1. **Create a Plane**: 
   - Generate a new plane object in the scene.
   - Position the plane at the origin (0, 0, 0).

2. **Apply an Emission Shader**: 
   - Create a new material with an emission shader.
   - Allow customization of the emission color and intensity.
   - Assign this material to the plane.

3. **Add a Boolean Modifier**: 
   - Introduce a boolean modifier to the plane.
   - Set it up to perform union, difference, or intersect operations with another selected object.

4. **Create UV Map**: 
   - Generate a UV map for the plane.
   - Unwrap the UV map to ensure proper texture mapping.

5. **Add a Radio Button in the UI**: 
   - Create a custom UI panel in the Blender interface.
   - Incorporate radio buttons that allow the user to switch between different emission shader presets.

6. **Use Geometry Nodes to Create Dynamic Grass**: 
   - Implement geometry nodes to populate the scene with dynamic grass.
   - Ensure the grass reacts to wind forces and interacts with other objects.

7. **Set Up Studio Lighting**: 
   - Configure a three-point studio lighting setup.
   - Include a key light, fill light, and rim light.
   - Allow adjustable parameters for strength and color of each light.

8. **Animate the Emission Shader**: 
   - Create an animation for the emission shader’s intensity and color over a timeline.
   - Simulate effects like pulsing or flickering.

9. **Integrate Camera Rig**: 
   - Add a camera rig with predefined movements.
   - Set keyframes to navigate around the scene, showcasing the plane and dynamic grass.

10. **Render Settings Optimization**: 
    - Configure render settings for high-quality output.
    - Set resolution, samples, and enable denoising.
    - Set up an automated rendering process upon script execution.

Ensure the script is modular, well-commented, and includes error handling to manage potential issues during execution. The final output should produce a visually appealing scene demonstrating the combined functionalities.

Every step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.

==========================
BLENDER INSTRUCTION LOOKUP
==========================

Hey GPT Assistant, it looks like you got an error.

Here are some proven Python practices that are known to work for this type of error.

Make sure to apply any and all relevant instructions to your fix.

If ever get conflicting instructions, use these instructions first, these are all tested.


1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.

5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.
Avoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.
Additionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.

9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.
It will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.

For example, don't do this:
if bpy.context.object is None:
    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))

Instead, do this:
if not bpy.context.selected_objects:
    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))

10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,
create the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.
This ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.

11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.
Try to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.
Avoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops.
Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable, within the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.
Ensure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\n) to improve readability in the console.
For example: `print("\nError: Object not found")`

=====================
BLENDER MANUAL LOOKUP
=====================

We looked up the error in the Blender 4.3 MANUAL for you:

The error message you encountered indicates that the Boolean modifier's target object cannot be set to itself. This is a restriction in Blender to prevent circular references. The relevant section from the Blender Manual regarding the Boolean modifier is as follows:

---

### Boolean Modifier

The Boolean modifier allows you to perform operations on meshes using other meshes as operands. The operations available are:

- **Intersect**: Keeps everything inside both the target mesh and the modified mesh.
- **Union**: Adds the target mesh or collection to the modified mesh, removing any interior faces.
- **Difference**: Subtracts the target mesh from the modified mesh, keeping everything outside of the target mesh.

#### Operand Type
- **Object**: The target is a mesh object.
- **Collection**: The target is a collection. When the target is a collection and the Solver is Fast, the Intersect operation is not allowed.

#### Object
- The name of the target mesh object. **Note**: The target object cannot be the same as the object to which the modifier is applied.

#### Solver
- **Fast**: Uses a mathematically simple solver which offers the best performance; however, this solver lacks support for overlapping geometry.
- **Exact**: Uses a mathematically complex solver which offers the best results and has full support for overlapping geometry; however, this solver is much slower than the Fast Solver.

#### Solver Options
- **Self Intersection**: Correctly calculates cases when one or both operands have self-intersections, which involves more calculations making it slower.
