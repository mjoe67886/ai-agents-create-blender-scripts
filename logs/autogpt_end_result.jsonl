Select the object named 'suburban house Mesh.001' to apply the material and texture.\n2. Create a new material for the selected object.\n3. Add a Principled BSDF shader to the material.\n4. Add a Brick Texture node and connect it to the Principled BSDF shader for the brick pattern.\n5.

Add a Displacement node to the material for real displacement, ensuring that Cycles is enabled in the render settings.\n8. Add a Subdivision Surface Modifier to the object and enable Experimental Features to enhance geometry for displacement.\n9. Add a Normal Map node and a Bump node to improve surface details of the material.\n10. Set the Displacement and Bump settings in the material properties to utilize the added nodes.\n11. Switch to Edit Mode for the object and unwrap it using UV > Smart UV Project for proper UV mapping.\n12.

Ensure the Image Texture node is selected in the Shader Editor and click Bake in the Bake section to bake the texture.\n16. After baking, open the UV/Image Editor and save the baked image using Image > Save As.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.2 Manual.\n\nEND OF ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY EXTRA INSTRUCTION BELOW THAT'S RELEVANT TO THE ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n2. Includes try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause. Always provide meaningful error messages.\n3. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n4. Assumes the Blender 4.2 environment.\n5. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n6. This is a list of PIP libraries you could use when generating scripts:\n\ncv2, ffmpeg, matplotlib, PIL, pipwin, psutil, pyaudio, pyautogui, pyperclip, pywinctl, skimage, tqdm, tzdata, dateutil, pytz, pydantic, tiktoken, selenium, cryptography, keyboard, halo, lxml, pynput, scipy, plotly, pygments\n\n7. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\n8. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n9. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\n\n10. Always use the `frame` keyword instead of `index` when inserting keyframes.\nExample: leg_bones[bone].keyframe_insert(data_path='rotation_euler', frame=frame)\n11. Ensure that all bone rotation modes are set to 'XYZ' Euler if using 'data_path='rotation_euler'.\n   Example:\n   # Set the rotation mode of all bones in the active object to 'XYZ' Euler\n   def set_bone_rotation_mode_to_euler():\n       rig = bpy.context.object\n       bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='POSE')\n       for bone in rig.pose.bones:\n           bone.rotation_mode = 'XYZ'\n\n   # Ensure the active object is an armature\n   if bpy.context.object and bpy.context.object.type == 'ARMATURE':\n       set_bone_rotation_mode_to_euler()\n12. Animate character bones locally to ensure consistent direction of movement.\n\n13. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n14. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n15. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\n\n16. In Blender 4.2 and later, you only need to link the object to the new collection. Unlinking the object from its original collection is not necessary and can lead to errors. The unlinking functionality is meant solely to remove items from a collection. When moving an object to a new collection, unlinking happens automatically. Ensure your scripts handle this correctly to avoid 'not in collection' or 'not in scene collection' errors.\n\nExample:\n\n# Create a collection and add the cube to it\ncollection = bpy.data.collections.new(name=\"TestCollection\")\nbpy.context.scene.collection.children.link(collection)\ncollection.objects.link(cube)\n\n17.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "START OF ORIGINAL REQUEST:\n\nwrite-code\n\nCreate a Blender script that will:\n\n1. Select the object named 'suburban house Mesh.001' to apply the material and texture.\n2. Create a new material for the selected object.\n3. Add a Principled BSDF shader to the material.\n4.

Ensure the Image Texture node is selected in the Shader Editor. Click Bake in the Bake section to bake the texture, confirming that only the newly created brick material is used for baking, ignoring any other materials present.\n16. After baking, open the UV/Image Editor and save the baked image using Image > Save As, saving it to a preferred location.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.2 Manual.\n\nEND OF ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY EXTRA INSTRUCTION BELOW THAT'S RELEVANT TO THE ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n2. Includes try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause. Always provide meaningful error messages.\n\n3. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n4. Assumes the Blender 4.2 environment.\n\n5. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n6. This is a list of PIP libraries you could use when generating scripts:\n\ncv2, ffmpeg, matplotlib, PIL, pipwin, psutil, pyaudio, pyautogui, pyperclip, pywinctl, skimage, tqdm, tzdata, dateutil, pytz, pydantic, tiktoken, selenium, cryptography, keyboard, halo, lxml, pynput, scipy, plotly, pygments\nDo not generate any scripts that do not use these modules.\n\n7. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\n8. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n9. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\n\n10. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n11. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. In Blender 4.2 and later, you only need to link the object to the new collection. Unlinking the object from its original collection is not necessary and can lead to errors. The unlinking functionality is meant solely to remove items from a collection. When moving an object to a new collection, unlinking happens automatically. Ensure your scripts handle this correctly to avoid 'not in collection' or 'not in scene collection' errors.\n\nExample:\n\n# Create a collection and add the cube to it\ncollection = bpy.data.collections.new(name=\"TestCollection\")\nbpy.context.scene.collection.children.link(collection)\ncollection.objects.link(cube)\n\n14.

After baking, open the UV/Image Editor and save the baked image using Image > Save As, saving it to a preferred location.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.2 Manual.\n\nEND OF ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY EXTRA INSTRUCTION BELOW THAT'S RELEVANT TO THE ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n2. Includes try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause. Always provide meaningful error messages.\n\n3. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n4. Assumes the Blender 4.2 environment.\n\n5. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n6. This is a list of PIP libraries you could use when generating scripts:\n\ncv2, ffmpeg, matplotlib, PIL, pipwin, psutil, pyaudio, pyautogui, pyperclip, pywinctl, skimage, tqdm, tzdata, dateutil, pytz, pydantic, tiktoken, selenium, cryptography, keyboard, halo, lxml, pynput, scipy, plotly, pygments\nDo not generate any scripts that do not use these modules.\n\n7. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\n8. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n9. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\n\n10. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n11. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. In Blender 4.2 and later, you only need to link the object to the new collection. Unlinking the object from its original collection is not necessary and can lead to errors. The unlinking functionality is meant solely to remove items from a collection. When moving an object to a new collection, unlinking happens automatically. Ensure your scripts handle this correctly to avoid 'not in collection' or 'not in scene collection' errors.\n\nExample:\n\n# Create a collection and add the cube to it\ncollection = bpy.data.collections.new(name=\"TestCollection\")\nbpy.context.scene.collection.children.link(collection)\ncollection.objects.link(cube)\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.2.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou MUST respond with JSON format\n\nThis is an example of how the code line that received an error is supposed to be written.\nLook at the example and see if it shows how to write the item referenced in the error message.\nOnly modify the original code to fix that specific issue, ensuring,\nthe original intention of the script remains unchanged.\nIf the example does not directly match the error, skip the modification.\n\n\n\nThis is an example of how the code line that received an error is supposed to be written.\nLook at the example and see if it shows how to write the item referenced in the error message.\nOnly modify the original code to fix that specific issue, ensuring,\nthe original intention of the script remains unchanged.\nIf the example does not directly match the error, skip the modification.\n\n\n\nGiven the original request above, plus this error message we got after running the script:\n\n    Reloading external rigs...\n    Reloading external metarigs...\n    *** SCRIPT STARTED ***\n    Object selected\n    New material created\n    Default nodes cleared\n    Principled BSDF shader added\n    Brick Texture node added and configured\n    Mapping node added\n    Texture Coordinate node added\n    Nodes linked\n    An error occurred: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'inputs'\n    *** SCRIPT COMPLETED ***\n    Read blend: \"C:\\Users\\W\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\temp_blender_file.blend\"\n    Saved session recovery to \"C:\\Users\\W\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\quit.blend\"\n    \n    \n    \n\nPlease fix the code.

Start by importing the necessary modules: `bpy`, `os`, and `math`. These are essential for accessing Blender's Python API, handling file paths, and performing mathematical operations, respectively.\n\n2. Ensure the object you want to work with is present in the scene. Use `bpy.data.objects.get('suburban house Mesh.001')` to retrieve the object. If the object is not found, raise a `ValueError` to alert the user.\n\n3. Create a new material named 'BrickMaterial' and enable nodes for it. Append this material to the object's material list to ensure it is applied to the object.\n\n4. Access the material's node tree to manipulate shader nodes. Clear any default nodes to start with a clean slate.\n\n5. Add a Principled BSDF shader node and position it at coordinates (0, 0) in the node editor. This node will serve as the main shader for the material.\n\n6. Add a Material Output node and position it at (400, 0). Connect the 'BSDF' output of the Principled BSDF node to the 'Surface' input of the Material Output node to complete the basic shader setup.\n\n7. Introduce a Brick Texture node at (-200, 0) and connect its 'Color' output to the 'Base Color' input of the Principled BSDF node. This will provide the brick pattern for the material.\n\n8. Set the colors for the Brick Texture node: Color1 to red `(1, 0, 0, 1)`, Color2 to brown `(0.6, 0.3, 0.1, 1)`, and Mortar to light gray `(0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 1)`.\n\n9. Add a Texture Coordinate node at (-600, 0) to provide texture mapping coordinates.\n\n10. Add a Mapping node at (-400, 0) and connect the 'Generated' output of the Texture Coordinate node to the 'Vector' input of the Mapping node. Then, connect the 'Vector' output of the Mapping node to the 'Vector' input of the Brick Texture node.\n\n11. Add a Displacement node at (200, -200) and connect its 'Displacement' output to the 'Displacement' input of the Material Output node. This will allow for displacement mapping if needed.\n\n12. Add a Subdivision Surface Modifier to the object to smooth its geometry. Set the levels and render levels to 2 for a moderate level of detail.\n\n13. Add a Normal Map node at (-200, -200) and connect its 'Normal' output to the 'Normal' input of the Principled BSDF node. This will allow for normal mapping.\n\n14. Add a Bump node at (-400, -200) and connect its 'Normal' output to the 'Color' input of the Normal Map node. This will provide additional surface detail.\n\n15. Switch the object to Edit Mode and perform a Smart UV Project to unwrap the object's UVs. This is necessary for proper texture mapping.\n\n16. Add an Image Texture node at (-600, -200) and create a new image named 'Brick_Bake' with dimensions 4096x4096. This image will be used for baking.\n\n17. Set the render engine to Cycles to ensure compatibility with the baking process.\n\n18. Configure the bake settings to use the 'DIFFUSE' bake type and enable the direct, indirect, and color passes.\n\n19. Select the Image Texture node as the active node to ensure it is the target for the bake.\n\n20. Perform the bake operation using `bpy.ops.object.bake(type='DIFFUSE')`. This will bake the diffuse color information to the image.\n\n21. Save the baked image to a specified directory on the user's desktop. Create the directory if it does not exist and save the image as 'Brick_Bake.png'.\n\n22. Handle any exceptions that occur during the script execution and print an error message if needed.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.2 Manual and API.\n\nEND OF ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY EXTRA INSTRUCTION BELOW THAT'S RELEVANT TO THE ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. The end user has either selected the entire file in the text editor or a specific part of the file and is asking you to fix the code.\nIf the entire file is selected, fix the code based on the user's prompt. If only a selection is provided, fix errors such as typos or incorrect operators,\nwithin the selection while maintaining the code as is. You must return the code to the user exactly as is except for any necessary fixes that you applied.\n\n2. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n3. Includes try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause. Always provide meaningful error messages.\n4. Use `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n5. Assume the Blender 4.2 environment.\n\n6. Provide full code with no placeholders.\n\n7. This is a list of PIP libraries you could use when generating scripts:\n\ncv2, ffmpeg, matplotlib, PIL, pipwin, psutil, pyaudio, pyautogui, pyperclip, pywinctl, skimage, tqdm, tzdata, dateutil, pytz, pydantic, tiktoken, selenium, cryptography, keyboard, halo, lxml, pynput, scipy, plotly, pygments\n\n8. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\n9. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n10. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\n\n11. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n12. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n13. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n14. In Blender 4.2 and later, you only need to link the object to the new collection. Unlinking the object from its original collection is not necessary and can lead to errors. The unlinking functionality is meant solely to remove items from a collection. When moving an object to a new collection, unlinking happens automatically. Ensure your scripts handle this correctly to avoid 'not in collection' or 'not in scene collection' errors.\n\nExample:\n\n# Create a collection and add the cube to it\ncollection = bpy.data.collections.new(name=\"TestCollection\")\nbpy.context.scene.collection.children.link(collection)\ncollection.objects.link(cube)\n\n15. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.2.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nThe original script had an error related to the 'CyclesRenderSettings' object not having a 'bake' attribute. This needs to be corrected. Additionally, the script should be updated to ensure compatibility with Blender 4.2 and follow best practices for context overrides and error handling.\n\nREASONING:\nThe error indicates that the script is trying to access an attribute that doesn't exist. By following the correct API usage and ensuring proper context management, the script can be made to work correctly.\n\nPLAN:\n- Correct the attribute error related to 'CyclesRenderSettings'.\n- Ensure proper context overrides using 'with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):'.\n- Add meaningful error messages in try-except blocks.\n- Ensure the script is compatible with Blender 4.2.\n- Add print statements for debugging and clarity.\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe original script did not handle the context overrides correctly and had an incorrect attribute access.

The script is intended to work with a mesh named 'suburban house Mesh.001' that is currently selected in the scene. Every step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.2 Manual.\n\n1. I will start by ensuring that the object named 'suburban house Mesh.001' is selected and retrieved correctly. I will check if the object exists in the scene using `bpy.data.objects.get(obj_name)` and raise an error if it is not found.\n\n2. I will create a new material named 'BrickMaterial' and enable the use of nodes for this material. This will be done using `bpy.data.materials.new(name='BrickMaterial')` and setting `material.use_nodes = True`.\n\n3. I will clear the default nodes from the material's node tree. This involves iterating through the existing nodes and removing them using `nodes.remove(node)`.\n\n4. I will add a Principled BSDF shader node to the material. This will be done by creating a new node of type 'ShaderNodeBsdfPrincipled' and setting its location.\n\n5. I will add a Material Output node to the material's node tree and connect the output of the Principled BSDF shader to the Surface input of the Material Output node.\n\n6. I will add a Brick Texture node to the material and connect its Color output to the Base Color input of the Principled BSDF shader.\n\n7. I will set the colors for the Brick Texture node, specifically for Color1, Color2, and Mortar inputs.\n\n8. I will add a Texture Coordinate node to the material and connect its Generated output to a Mapping node's Vector input.\n\n9. I will add a Mapping node and connect its output to the Vector input of the Brick Texture node.\n\n10. I will add a Displacement node and connect its output to the Displacement input of the Material Output node.\n\n11. I will add a Subdivision Surface Modifier to the object. This will be done using `bpy.ops.object.modifier_add(type='SUBSURF')` and setting the levels for both the viewport and render.\n\n12. I will add a Normal Map node and connect its output to the Normal input of the Principled BSDF shader.\n\n13. I will add a Bump node and connect its output to the Color input of the Normal Map node.\n\n14. I will switch to Edit Mode and perform a Smart UV Project on the object to unwrap the UVs. This will be done using `bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')` followed by `bpy.ops.uv.smart_project()` and then returning to Object Mode.\n\n15. I will add an Image Texture node to the material and create a new image with specified dimensions.\n\n16. I will set the render engine to Cycles by modifying `bpy.context.scene.render.engine`.\n\n17. I will configure the bake settings for the Cycles render engine, ensuring that the appropriate passes are enabled for baking.\n\n18. I will select the Image Texture node as the active node in the node tree.\n\n19. I will perform the bake operation using `bpy.ops.object.bake(type='DIFFUSE')`.\n\n20. Finally, I will save the baked image to a specified directory on the Desktop, ensuring that the directory exists before saving the image.\n\nBy following these steps, I will ensure that the script functions correctly without introducing any additional changes.\n\nEND OF ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY EXTRA INSTRUCTION BELOW THAT'S RELEVANT TO THE ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. The end user has either selected the entire file in the text editor or a specific part of the file and is asking you to fix the code.\nIf the entire file is selected, fix the code based on the user's prompt. If only a selection is provided, fix errors such as typos or incorrect operators,\nwithin the selection while maintaining the code as is. You must return the code to the user exactly as is except for any necessary fixes that you applied.\n\n2. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n3. Includes try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause. Always provide meaningful error messages.\n4. Use `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n5. Assume the Blender 4.2 environment.\n\n6. Provide full code with no placeholders.\n\n7. This is a list of PIP libraries you could use when generating scripts:\n\ncv2, ffmpeg, matplotlib, PIL, pipwin, psutil, pyaudio, pyautogui, pyperclip, pywinctl, skimage, tqdm, tzdata, dateutil, pytz, pydantic, tiktoken, selenium, cryptography, keyboard, halo, lxml, pynput, scipy, plotly, pygments\n\n8. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\n9. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n10. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\n\n11. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n12. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n13. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n14. In Blender 4.2 and later, you only need to link the object to the new collection. Unlinking the object from its original collection is not necessary and can lead to errors. The unlinking functionality is meant solely to remove items from a collection. When moving an object to a new collection, unlinking happens automatically. Ensure your scripts handle this correctly to avoid 'not in collection' or 'not in scene collection' errors.\n\nExample:\n\n# Create a collection and add the cube to it\ncollection = bpy.data.collections.new(name=\"TestCollection\")\nbpy.context.scene.collection.children.link(collection)\ncollection.objects.link(cube)\n\n15. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.2.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nI will fix the provided script to ensure it works correctly in Blender 4.2, addressing the specific error related to 'CyclesRenderSettings' object not having a 'bake' attribute.\n\nREASONING:\nThe error indicates that the script is trying to access an attribute that doesn't exist in the 'CyclesRenderSettings' object.

The script is intended to work with a mesh named 'suburban house Mesh.001' that is currently selected in the scene. Every step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.2 Manual.\n\n1. I will start by ensuring that the object named 'suburban house Mesh.001' is selected and retrieved correctly. I will check if the object exists in the scene using `bpy.data.objects.get(obj_name)` and raise an error if it is not found.\n\n2. I will create a new material named 'BrickMaterial' and enable the use of nodes for this material. This will be done using `bpy.data.materials.new(name='BrickMaterial')` and setting `material.use_nodes = True`.\n\n3. I will clear the default nodes from the material's node tree. This involves iterating through the existing nodes and removing them using `nodes.remove(node)`.\n\n4. I will add a Principled BSDF shader node to the material. This will be done by creating a new node of type 'ShaderNodeBsdfPrincipled' and setting its location.\n\n5. I will add a Material Output node to the material's node tree and connect the output of the Principled BSDF shader to the Surface input of the Material Output node.\n\n6. I will add a Brick Texture node to the material and connect its Color output to the Base Color input of the Principled BSDF shader.\n\n7. I will set the colors for the Brick Texture node, specifically for Color1, Color2, and Mortar inputs.\n\n8. I will add a Texture Coordinate node to the material and connect its Generated output to a Mapping node's Vector input.\n\n9. I will add a Mapping node and connect its output to the Vector input of the Brick Texture node.\n\n10. I will add a Displacement node and connect its output to the Displacement input of the Material Output node.\n\n11. I will add a Subdivision Surface Modifier to the object. This will be done using `bpy.ops.object.modifier_add(type='SUBSURF')` and setting the levels for both the viewport and render.\n\n12. I will add a Normal Map node and connect its output to the Normal input of the Principled BSDF shader.\n\n13. I will add a Bump node and connect its output to the Color input of the Normal Map node.\n\n14. I will switch to Edit Mode and perform a Smart UV Project on the object to unwrap the UVs. This will be done using `bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')` followed by `bpy.ops.uv.smart_project()` and then returning to Object Mode.\n\n15. I will add an Image Texture node to the material and create a new image with specified dimensions.\n\n16. I will set the render engine to Cycles by modifying `bpy.context.scene.render.engine`.\n\n17. I will configure the bake settings for the Cycles render engine, ensuring that the appropriate passes are enabled for baking.\n\n18. I will select the Image Texture node as the active node in the node tree.\n\n19. I will perform the bake operation using `bpy.ops.object.bake(type='DIFFUSE')`.\n\n20. Finally, I will save the baked image to a specified directory on the Desktop, ensuring that the directory exists before saving the image.\n\nBy following these steps, I will ensure that the script functions correctly without introducing any additional changes.\n\nEND OF ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY EXTRA INSTRUCTION BELOW THAT'S RELEVANT TO THE ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. The end user has either selected the entire file in the text editor or a specific part of the file and is asking you to fix the code.\nIf the entire file is selected, fix the code based on the user's prompt. If only a selection is provided, fix errors such as typos or incorrect operators,\nwithin the selection while maintaining the code as is. You must return the code to the user exactly as is except for any necessary fixes that you applied.\n\n2. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n3. Includes try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause. Always provide meaningful error messages.\n4. Use `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n5. Assume the Blender 4.2 environment.\n\n6. Provide full code with no placeholders.\n\n7. This is a list of PIP libraries you could use when generating scripts:\n\ncv2, ffmpeg, matplotlib, PIL, pipwin, psutil, pyaudio, pyautogui, pyperclip, pywinctl, skimage, tqdm, tzdata, dateutil, pytz, pydantic, tiktoken, selenium, cryptography, keyboard, halo, lxml, pynput, scipy, plotly, pygments\n\n8. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\n9. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n10. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\n\n11. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n12. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n13. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n14. In Blender 4.2 and later, you only need to link the object to the new collection. Unlinking the object from its original collection is not necessary and can lead to errors. The unlinking functionality is meant solely to remove items from a collection. When moving an object to a new collection, unlinking happens automatically. Ensure your scripts handle this correctly to avoid 'not in collection' or 'not in scene collection' errors.\n\nExample:\n\n# Create a collection and add the cube to it\ncollection = bpy.data.collections.new(name=\"TestCollection\")\nbpy.context.scene.collection.children.link(collection)\ncollection.objects.link(cube)\n\n15. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.2.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou MUST respond with JSON format\n\nGiven the original request above, plus this error message we got after running the script:\n\n    Reloading external rigs...\n    Reloading external metarigs...\n    *** SCRIPT STARTED ***\n    An error occurred: 'CyclesRenderSettings' object has no attribute 'bake'\n    *** SCRIPT COMPLETED ***\n    Read blend: \"C:\\Users\\W\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\temp_blender_file.blend\"\n    Saved session recovery to \"C:\\Users\\W\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\quit.blend\"\n    \n    \n    \n\nPlease fix the code. Do not change the original code, aside from the fixes.

The script is intended to work with a mesh named 'suburban house Mesh.001' that is currently selected in the scene. Every step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.2 Manual.\n\n1. I will start by ensuring that the object named 'suburban house Mesh.001' is selected and retrieved correctly. I will check if the object exists in the scene using `bpy.data.objects.get(obj_name)` and raise an error if it is not found.\n\n2. I will create a new material named 'BrickMaterial' and enable the use of nodes for this material. This will be done using `bpy.data.materials.new(name='BrickMaterial')` and setting `material.use_nodes = True`.\n\n3. I will clear the default nodes from the material's node tree. This involves iterating through the existing nodes and removing them using `nodes.remove(node)`.\n\n4. I will add a Principled BSDF shader node to the material. This will be done by creating a new node of type 'ShaderNodeBsdfPrincipled' and setting its location.\n\n5. I will add a Material Output node to the material's node tree and connect the output of the Principled BSDF shader to the Surface input of the Material Output node.\n\n6. I will add a Brick Texture node to the material and connect its Color output to the Base Color input of the Principled BSDF shader.\n\n7. I will set the colors for the Brick Texture node, specifically for Color1, Color2, and Mortar inputs.\n\n8. I will add a Texture Coordinate node to the material and connect its Generated output to a Mapping node's Vector input.\n\n9. I will add a Mapping node and connect its output to the Vector input of the Brick Texture node.\n\n10. I will add a Displacement node and connect its output to the Displacement input of the Material Output node.\n\n11. I will add a Subdivision Surface Modifier to the object. This will be done using `bpy.ops.object.modifier_add(type='SUBSURF')` and setting the levels for both the viewport and render.\n\n12. I will add a Normal Map node and connect its output to the Normal input of the Principled BSDF shader.\n\n13. I will add a Bump node and connect its output to the Color input of the Normal Map node.\n\n14. I will switch to Edit Mode and perform a Smart UV Project on the object to unwrap the UVs. This will be done using `bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')` followed by `bpy.ops.uv.smart_project()` and then returning to Object Mode.\n\n15. I will add an Image Texture node to the material and create a new image with specified dimensions.\n\n16. I will set the render engine to Cycles by modifying `bpy.context.scene.render.engine`.\n\n17. I will configure the bake settings for the Cycles render engine, ensuring that the appropriate passes are enabled for baking.\n\n18. I will select the Image Texture node as the active node in the node tree.\n\n19. I will perform the bake operation using `bpy.ops.object.bake(type='DIFFUSE')`.\n\n20. Finally, I will save the baked image to a specified directory on the Desktop, ensuring that the directory exists before saving the image.\n\nBy following these steps, I will ensure that the script functions correctly without introducing any additional changes.\n\nEND OF ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY EXTRA INSTRUCTION BELOW THAT'S RELEVANT TO THE ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. The end user has either selected the entire file in the text editor or a specific part of the file and is asking you to fix the code.\nIf the entire file is selected, fix the code based on the user's prompt. If only a selection is provided, fix errors such as typos or incorrect operators,\nwithin the selection while maintaining the code as is. You must return the code to the user exactly as is except for any necessary fixes that you applied.\n\n2. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n3. Includes try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause. Always provide meaningful error messages.\n4. Use `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n5. Assume the Blender 4.2 environment.\n\n6. Provide full code with no placeholders.\n\n7. This is a list of PIP libraries you could use when generating scripts:\n\ncv2, ffmpeg, matplotlib, PIL, pipwin, psutil, pyaudio, pyautogui, pyperclip, pywinctl, skimage, tqdm, tzdata, dateutil, pytz, pydantic, tiktoken, selenium, cryptography, keyboard, halo, lxml, pynput, scipy, plotly, pygments\n\n8. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\n9. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n10. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\n\n11. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n12. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n13. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n14. In Blender 4.2 and later, you only need to link the object to the new collection. Unlinking the object from its original collection is not necessary and can lead to errors. The unlinking functionality is meant solely to remove items from a collection. When moving an object to a new collection, unlinking happens automatically. Ensure your scripts handle this correctly to avoid 'not in collection' or 'not in scene collection' errors.\n\nExample:\n\n# Create a collection and add the cube to it\ncollection = bpy.data.collections.new(name=\"TestCollection\")\nbpy.context.scene.collection.children.link(collection)\ncollection.objects.link(cube)\n\n15. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.2.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou MUST respond with JSON format\n\nThis is an example of how the code line that received an error is supposed to be written.\nLook at the example and see if it shows how to write the item referenced in the error message.\nOnly modify the original code to fix that specific issue, ensuring,\nthe original intention of the script remains unchanged.\nIf the example does not directly match the error, skip the modification.\n\n\n\nGiven the original request above, plus this error message we got after running the script:\n\n    Reloading external rigs...\n    Reloading external metarigs...\n    *** SCRIPT STARTED ***\n    An error occurred: 'CyclesRenderSettings' object has no attribute 'bake'\n    *** SCRIPT COMPLETED ***\n    Read blend: \"C:\\Users\\W\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\temp_blender_file.blend\"\n    Saved session recovery to \"C:\\Users\\W\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\quit.blend\"\n    \n    \n    \n\nPlease fix the code.

The script is intended to work with a mesh named 'suburban house Mesh.001' that is currently selected in the scene. Every step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.2 Manual.\n\n1. I will start by ensuring that the object named 'suburban house Mesh.001' is selected and retrieved correctly. I will check if the object exists in the scene using `bpy.data.objects.get(obj_name)` and raise an error if it is not found.\n\n2. I will create a new material named 'BrickMaterial' and enable the use of nodes for this material. This will be done using `bpy.data.materials.new(name='BrickMaterial')` and setting `material.use_nodes = True`.\n\n3. I will clear the default nodes from the material's node tree. This involves iterating through the existing nodes and removing them using `nodes.remove(node)`.\n\n4. I will add a Principled BSDF shader node to the material. This will be done by creating a new node of type 'ShaderNodeBsdfPrincipled' and setting its location.\n\n5. I will add a Material Output node to the material's node tree and connect the output of the Principled BSDF shader to the Surface input of the Material Output node.\n\n6. I will add a Brick Texture node to the material and connect its Color output to the Base Color input of the Principled BSDF shader.\n\n7. I will set the colors for the Brick Texture node, specifically for Color1, Color2, and Mortar inputs.\n\n8. I will add a Texture Coordinate node to the material and connect its Generated output to a Mapping node's Vector input.\n\n9. I will add a Mapping node and connect its output to the Vector input of the Brick Texture node.\n\n10. I will add a Displacement node and connect its output to the Displacement input of the Material Output node.\n\n11. I will add a Subdivision Surface Modifier to the object. This will be done using `bpy.ops.object.modifier_add(type='SUBSURF')` and setting the levels for both the viewport and render.\n\n12. I will add a Normal Map node and connect its output to the Normal input of the Principled BSDF shader.\n\n13. I will add a Bump node and connect its output to the Color input of the Normal Map node.\n\n14. I will switch to Edit Mode and perform a Smart UV Project on the object to unwrap the UVs. This will be done using `bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')` followed by `bpy.ops.uv.smart_project()` and then returning to Object Mode.\n\n15. I will add an Image Texture node to the material and create a new image with specified dimensions.\n\n16. I will set the render engine to Cycles by modifying `bpy.context.scene.render.engine`.\n\n17. I will configure the bake settings for the Cycles render engine, ensuring that the appropriate passes are enabled for baking.\n\n18. I will select the Image Texture node as the active node in the node tree.\n\n19. I will perform the bake operation using `bpy.ops.object.bake(type='DIFFUSE')`.\n\n20. Finally, I will save the baked image to a specified directory on the Desktop, ensuring that the directory exists before saving the image.\n\nBy following these steps, I will ensure that the script functions correctly without introducing any additional changes.\n\nEND OF ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY EXTRA INSTRUCTION BELOW THAT'S RELEVANT TO THE ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. The end user has either selected the entire file in the text editor or a specific part of the file and is asking you to fix the code.\nIf the entire file is selected, fix the code based on the user's prompt. If only a selection is provided, fix errors such as typos or incorrect operators,\nwithin the selection while maintaining the code as is. You must return the code to the user exactly as is except for any necessary fixes that you applied.\n\n2. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n3. Includes try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause. Always provide meaningful error messages.\n4. Use `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n5. Assume the Blender 4.2 environment.\n\n6. Provide full code with no placeholders.\n\n7. This is a list of PIP libraries you could use when generating scripts:\n\ncv2, ffmpeg, matplotlib, PIL, pipwin, psutil, pyaudio, pyautogui, pyperclip, pywinctl, skimage, tqdm, tzdata, dateutil, pytz, pydantic, tiktoken, selenium, cryptography, keyboard, halo, lxml, pynput, scipy, plotly, pygments\n\n8. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\n9. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n10. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\n\n11. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n12. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n13. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n14. In Blender 4.2 and later, you only need to link the object to the new collection. Unlinking the object from its original collection is not necessary and can lead to errors. The unlinking functionality is meant solely to remove items from a collection. When moving an object to a new collection, unlinking happens automatically. Ensure your scripts handle this correctly to avoid 'not in collection' or 'not in scene collection' errors.\n\nExample:\n\n# Create a collection and add the cube to it\ncollection = bpy.data.collections.new(name=\"TestCollection\")\nbpy.context.scene.collection.children.link(collection)\ncollection.objects.link(cube)\n\n15. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.2.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou MUST respond with JSON format\n\nThis is an example of how the code line that received an error is supposed to be written.\nLook at the example and see if it shows how to write the item referenced in the error message.\nOnly modify the original code to fix that specific issue, ensuring,\nthe original intention of the script remains unchanged.\nIf the example does not directly match the error, skip the modification.\n\n\n\nGiven the original request above, plus this error message we got after running the script:\n\n    Reloading external rigs...\n    Reloading external metarigs...\n    *** SCRIPT STARTED ***\n    An error occurred: 'CyclesRenderSettings' object has no attribute 'bake'\n    *** SCRIPT COMPLETED ***\n    Read blend: \"C:\\Users\\W\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\temp_blender_file.blend\"\n    Saved session recovery to \"C:\\Users\\W\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\quit.blend\"\n    \n    \n    \n\nPlease fix the code.

Set up rigging for the robot by creating an armature with bones for the torso, head, arms, and legs.\n12. Parent the robot's mesh objects to the corresponding bones in the armature for proper deformation during movement.\n13. Add constraints to the bones to allow for basic movement, ensuring that the arms, legs, and head can rotate at their joints.\n14. Finalize the script by ensuring all objects are created at the start to avoid missing object errors.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.2 Manual.\n\nEND OF ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY EXTRA INSTRUCTION BELOW THAT'S RELEVANT TO THE ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n2. Includes try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause. Always provide meaningful error messages.\n\n3. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n4. Assumes the Blender 4.2 environment.\n\n5. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n6. This is a list of PIP libraries you could use when generating scripts:\n\nrequests, pyperclip, pyautogui, psutil, openai, beautifulsoup4, tiktoken, SpeechRecognition, pygments, aiohttp, ffmpeg, pydub\n\n7. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\n8. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n9. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\n\n10. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n11. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. In Blender 4.2 and later, you only need to link the object to the new collection. Unlinking the object from its original collection is not necessary and can lead to errors. The unlinking functionality is meant solely to remove items from a collection. When moving an object to a new collection, unlinking happens automatically. Ensure your scripts handle this correctly to avoid 'not in collection' or 'not in scene collection' errors.\n\nExample:\n\n# Create a collection and add the cube to it\ncollection = bpy.data.collections.new(name=\"TestCollection\")\nbpy.context.scene.collection.children.link(collection)\ncollection.objects.link(cube)\n\n14.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "START OF ORIGINAL REQUEST:\n\nCreate a Blender script that will model a retro-styled robot reminiscent of classic 1950s sci-fi films. Follow these detailed steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the Blender Environment**: Start the script by importing the necessary Blender Python modules to access the Blender API.\n\n2. **Create the Robot's Torso**: Use a cube to create a boxy torso. Scale the cube to the desired dimensions to resemble a retro robot's body.\n\n3. **Add Arms and Legs**: \n   - For the arms, create two cylinders. Scale and position them to attach to the torso, ensuring they are cylindrical in shape.\n   - For the legs, create two additional cylinders, scaling them appropriately and positioning them beneath the torso to represent segmented limbs.\n\n4. **Design the Head**: Create a dome-shaped head using a UV sphere. Scale it to fit proportionally on top of the torso. \n\n5. **Add Antennas**: Use thin cylinders to create antennas on top of the head. Position them symmetrically.\n\n6. **Create Mechanical Joints**: Add small spheres or cubes at the joints of the arms and legs to represent mechanical joints. Position them at the connection points.\n\n7. **Detail the Control Panel**: On the front of the torso, create a flat rectangle to serve as a control panel. Add smaller cubes or other shapes to represent buttons and switches.\n\n8. **Add Transparent Sections**: Create sections of the torso or limbs that are transparent. Use a material with transparency settings to allow visibility of internal gears.\n\n9. **Model Gears**: Inside the transparent sections, create small cylinders or gears. Use a combination of scaling and positioning to make them visible through the transparent areas.\n\n10. **Apply Materials**: Assign a metallic material to the entire robot model. Adjust the material properties to achieve a shiny, reflective finish typical of retro robots.\n\n11. **Rig the Robot**: \n    - Create an armature for the robot. Add bones for the torso, head, arms, and legs.\n    - Ensure that the bones are positioned correctly to allow for basic movement.\n    - Set up constraints for the bones to enable rotating joints at the arms, legs, and head.\n\n12. **Finalize the Model**: Check the model for any adjustments needed in terms of proportions and positioning. Ensure all parts are correctly parented to the armature.\n\n13. **Save the Script**: End the script by saving the Blender file to preserve the robot model and rigging setup.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.2 Manual.\n\nEND OF ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY EXTRA INSTRUCTION BELOW THAT'S RELEVANT TO THE ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n2. Includes try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause. Always provide meaningful error messages.\n\n3. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n4. Assumes the Blender 4.2 environment.\n\n5. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n6. This is a list of PIP libraries you could use when generating scripts:\n\nrequests, pyperclip, pyautogui, psutil, openai, beautifulsoup4, tiktoken, SpeechRecognition, pygments, aiohttp, ffmpeg, pydub\n\n7. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\n8. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n9. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\n\n10. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n11. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. In Blender 4.2 and later, you only need to link the object to the new collection. Unlinking the object from its original collection is not necessary and can lead to errors. The unlinking functionality is meant solely to remove items from a collection. When moving an object to a new collection, unlinking happens automatically. Ensure your scripts handle this correctly to avoid 'not in collection' or 'not in scene collection' errors.\n\nExample:\n\n# Create a collection and add the cube to it\ncollection = bpy.data.collections.new(name=\"TestCollection\")\nbpy.context.scene.collection.children.link(collection)\ncollection.objects.link(cube)\n\n14.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "START OF ORIGINAL REQUEST:\n\nCreate a Blender script that will:\n\n1. **Initialize the Script**:\n    - Import the necessary Blender Python API modules (`bpy`, `mathutils`).\n    - Set up the main function to encapsulate the script logic.\n\n2. **Create the Robot's Torso**:\n    - Add a cube to represent the boxy torso.\n    - Scale the cube to appropriate dimensions for a torso.\n    - Add a control panel detail on the chest using a smaller inset cube or plane with a texture or material to simulate buttons and screens.\n\n3. **Create the Robot's Head**:\n    - Add a UV sphere or a dome (half-sphere) to represent the dome-shaped head.\n    - Position the head on top of the torso.\n    - Add antennas using cylinders or cones, positioned symmetrically on the head.\n\n4. **Create the Robot's Arms**:\n    - Add cylinders for the upper arms and forearms.\n    - Add spheres or smaller cylinders for the joints to allow for rotation.\n    - Position the arms symmetrically on the sides of the torso.\n    - Ensure the arms are segmented for a retro look.\n\n5. **Create the Robot's Legs**:\n    - Add cylinders for the thighs and shins.\n    - Add spheres or smaller cylinders for the knee joints.\n    - Position the legs symmetrically at the bottom of the torso.\n    - Ensure the legs are segmented for a retro look.\n\n6. **Add Mechanical Details**:\n    - Add gears and other mechanical details using additional cylinders and toruses.\n    - Position these details in visible areas, such as the joints and the control panel.\n    - Add transparent sections to the torso to reveal some of the internal gears.\n\n7. **Apply Materials**:\n    - Create a metallic material for the robot's body.\n    - Apply the metallic material to all parts of the robot.\n    - Create and apply different materials for the control panel, antennas, and gears to add visual interest.\n\n8. **Rig the Robot for Movement**:\n    - Add an armature to the robot.\n    - Create bones for the torso, head, arms, and legs.\n    - Parent the robot's mesh parts to the corresponding bones.\n    - Ensure the joints (shoulders, elbows, knees, and neck) are set up to allow for rotation.\n\n9. **Set Up Basic Animation Controls**:\n    - Add constraints to the bones to limit their rotation to realistic ranges.\n    - Create custom properties or drivers to control the movement of the robot's parts.\n    - Optionally, set up an IK (Inverse Kinematics) rig for easier animation of the limbs.\n\n10. **Finalize the Script**:\n    - Ensure all objects are named appropriately for easy identification.\n    - Add comments and documentation within the script for clarity.\n    - Test the script to ensure it runs without errors and produces the desired robot model.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.2 Manual and API.\n\nEND OF ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY EXTRA INSTRUCTION BELOW THAT'S RELEVANT TO THE ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n2. Includes try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause. Always provide meaningful error messages.\n\n3. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n4. Assumes the Blender 4.2 environment.\n\n5. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n6. This is a list of PIP libraries you could use when generating scripts:\n\nrequests, pyperclip, pyautogui, psutil, openai, beautifulsoup4, tiktoken, SpeechRecognition, pygments, aiohttp, ffmpeg, pydub\n\n7. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\n8. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n9. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\n\n10. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n11. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. In Blender 4.2 and later, you only need to link the object to the new collection. Unlinking the object from its original collection is not necessary and can lead to errors. The unlinking functionality is meant solely to remove items from a collection. When moving an object to a new collection, unlinking happens automatically. Ensure your scripts handle this correctly to avoid 'not in collection' or 'not in scene collection' errors.\n\nExample:\n\n# Create a collection and add the cube to it\ncollection = bpy.data.collections.new(name=\"TestCollection\")\nbpy.context.scene.collection.children.link(collection)\ncollection.objects.link(cube)\n\n14.

This is a list of PIP libraries you could use when generating scripts:\n\nrequests, pyperclip, pyautogui, psutil, openai, beautifulsoup4, tiktoken, SpeechRecognition, pygments, aiohttp, ffmpeg, pydub\n\n7. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\n8. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n9. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\n\n10. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n11. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. In Blender 4.2 and later, you only need to link the object to the new collection. Unlinking the object from its original collection is not necessary and can lead to errors. The unlinking functionality is meant solely to remove items from a collection. When moving an object to a new collection, unlinking happens automatically. Ensure your scripts handle this correctly to avoid 'not in collection' or 'not in scene collection' errors.\n\nExample:\n\n# Create a collection and add the cube to it\ncollection = bpy.data.collections.new(name=\"TestCollection\")\nbpy.context.scene.collection.children.link(collection)\ncollection.objects.link(cube)\n\n14.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "START OF ORIGINAL REQUEST:\n\nCreate a Blender script that will create a retro-styled robot model reminiscent of classic 1950s sci-fi films, with a boxy torso, cylindrical arms and legs, a dome-shaped head with antennas, and mechanical joints. The robot should have segmented limbs, a detailed control panel on the chest, and gears visible through certain transparent sections. The script should also include materials for a metallic finish and ensure the model is rigged for basic movement, with rotating joints at the arms, legs, and head. Follow these detailed steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the Script**:\n   - Import the necessary Blender Python modules (`bpy`, `bmesh`, `mathutils`).\n\n2. **Create the Torso**:\n   - Create a boxy torso using `bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add`.\n   - Scale and position the cube to form the torso.\n   - Add a detailed control panel on the chest using smaller cubes and planes.\n   - Add transparent sections using materials with transparency settings.\n\n3. **Create the Head**:\n   - Create a dome-shaped head using `bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add`.\n   - Scale and position the sphere to form the head.\n   - Add antennas using cylinders (`bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cylinder_add`).\n   - Position and scale the cylinders appropriately.\n\n4. **Create the Arms and Legs**:\n   - Create cylindrical arms and legs using `bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cylinder_add`.\n   - Segment the limbs by creating multiple cylinders and joining them.\n   - Add mechanical joints using smaller cylinders or spheres at the connections.\n\n5. **Add Gears and Mechanical Details**:\n   - Create gears using `bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_torus_add` and modify their properties to resemble gears.\n   - Position the gears inside the transparent sections of the torso.\n   - Add additional mechanical details using various primitives (cubes, cylinders, etc.).\n\n6. **Apply Materials**:\n   - Create a metallic material using `bpy.data.materials.new` and set its properties for a metallic finish.\n   - Assign the metallic material to the robot parts.\n   - Create a transparent material for the transparent sections and assign it accordingly.\n\n7. **Rig the Model**:\n   - Create an armature using `bpy.ops.object.armature_add`.\n   - Enter Edit Mode and add bones for the torso, head, arms, and legs.\n   - Position and scale the bones to match the robot's structure.\n   - Name the bones appropriately (e.g., \"Torso\", \"Head\", \"UpperArm.L\", \"LowerArm.L\", \"UpperLeg.L\", \"LowerLeg.L\", etc.).\n   - Ensure the bones are mirrored for symmetry.\n\n8. **Parent the Mesh to the Armature**:\n   - Select the robot mesh and the armature.\n   - Use `bpy.ops.object.parent_set` with the 'Armature Deform' option to parent the mesh to the armature.\n\n9. **Set Up Rotating Joints**:\n   - Enter Pose Mode and add constraints to the bones for basic movement.\n   - Use `bpy.ops.pose.constraint_add` to add rotation constraints to the arm, leg, and head bones.\n   - Configure the constraints to allow rotation around the appropriate axes.\n\n10. **Finalize the Script**:\n    - Ensure all objects are created at the start of the script to avoid missing object errors.\n    - Add comments and organize the script for readability.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.2 Manual and API.\n\n=== INSTRUCTIONS FOR ASSISTANT ===\nThis script has already been generated by a more advanced model. If you do not receive any error message along with this script, then please re-output the script exactly as you received it.\n\nIf you receive an error message along with this script, attempt to fix it using Python's or Blender Python's best coding practices.\nYour task is to ensure the original functionality is maintained while resolving errors.\n=== END OF INSTRUCTIONS ===\n\n\nEND OF ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY EXTRA INSTRUCTION BELOW THAT'S RELEVANT TO THE ORIGINAL REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n2. Includes try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause. Always provide meaningful error messages.\n\n3. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n4. Assumes the Blender 4.2 environment.\n\n5. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n6. This is a list of PIP libraries you could use when generating scripts:\n\nrequests, pyperclip, pyautogui, psutil, openai, beautifulsoup4, tiktoken, SpeechRecognition, pygments, aiohttp, ffmpeg, pydub\n\n7. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\n8. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n9. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\n\n10. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n11. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. In Blender 4.2 and later, you only need to link the object to the new collection. Unlinking the object from its original collection is not necessary and can lead to errors. The unlinking functionality is meant solely to remove items from a collection. When moving an object to a new collection, unlinking happens automatically. Ensure your scripts handle this correctly to avoid 'not in collection' or 'not in scene collection' errors.\n\nExample:\n\n# Create a collection and add the cube to it\ncollection = bpy.data.collections.new(name=\"TestCollection\")\nbpy.context.scene.collection.children.link(collection)\ncollection.objects.link(cube)\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.2.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou MUST respond with JSON format\n\nGiven the original request above, plus this error message we got after running the script:\n\n    Reloading external rigs...\n    Reloading external metarigs...\n    *** SCRIPT STARTED ***\n    An error occurred: Converting py args to operator properties: enum \"POSE\" not found in ('OBJECT', 'EDIT', 'SCULPT', 'VERTEX_PAINT', 'WEIGHT_PAINT', 'TEXTURE_PAINT')\n    *** SCRIPT COMPLETED ***\n    Read blend: \"C:\\Users\\W\\AppData\\Roaming\\Blender Foundation\\Blender\\4.2\\scripts\\addons\\blender_ai_thats_error_proof\\data\\autogpt\\workspace\\default.blend\"\n    Saved session recovery to \"C:\\Users\\W\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\quit.blend\"\n    \n    Blender quit\n    \n    \n    \n\nPlease fix the code. Do not change the original code, aside from the fixes. Do not replace sections with placeholders.\n\nMake sure to add relevant print statements so you know exactly what the code is doing.\n\nPlease note that we also added the following changes to the code:\n\nTo fix 'File Path' error ADDED trusted path to script:\n\nimport os\n# Define the paths\ndestination_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')\nTo fix 'File Path' error REMOVED error path from script:\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease maintain these changes along with your fix.\n\n\n\nThis is an example of how the code line that received an error is supposed to be written.\nLook at the example and see if it shows how to write the item referenced in the error message.\nOnly modify the original code to fix that specific issue, ensuring,\nthe original intention of the script remains unchanged.\nIf the example does not directly match the error, skip the modification.\n\n\n# Example of setting the mode to POSE correctly\nif bpy.context.object and bpy.context.object.type == 'ARMATURE':\n    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='POSE')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nThe error indicates that the script attempted to set the mode to 'POSE' but failed because the mode was not found. This suggests that the object was not an armature or the context was not correctly set. I will ensure the context is correctly set and the object is an armature before switching to 'POSE' mode.\n\nREASONING:\nBy ensuring the context is correctly set and the object is an armature, we can avoid the error and successfully switch to 'POSE' mode. Adding print statements will help trace the script's execution and identify any further issues.\n\nPLAN:\n- Ensure the context is correctly set before switching to 'POSE' mode\n- Add print statements to trace the script's execution\n- Maintain the original functionality and structure of the script\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe original script did not adequately check the context and object type before switching modes, leading to the error.

Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n16. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n17. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Always use the `frame` keyword instead of `index` when inserting keyframes.\nExample: leg_bones[bone].keyframe_insert(data_path='rotation_euler', frame=frame)\n\n16. Ensure that all bone rotation modes are set to 'XYZ' Euler if using 'data_path='rotation_euler'.\n   Example:\n   # Set the rotation mode of all bones in the active object to 'XYZ' Euler\n   def set_bone_rotation_mode_to_euler():\n       rig = bpy.context.object\n       bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='POSE')\n       for bone in rig.pose.bones:\n           bone.rotation_mode = 'XYZ'\n\n   # Ensure the active object is an armature\n   if bpy.context.object and bpy.context.object.type == 'ARMATURE':\n       set_bone_rotation_mode_to_euler()\n\n17. If you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "START OF USER REQUEST:\n\n#standard-boost\n\nCreate a Blender script that will:\n\n1. **Create a Suzanne (monkey head) mesh** at the center of the scene with a high polygon count.\n2. **Apply a toon shader** to Suzanne, customizing the shader with distinct color bands and edge outlines to achieve a cel-shaded effect.\n3. **Add a multiresolution modifier** to Suzanne, subdividing the mesh for detailed sculpting and ensuring it retains optimal performance.\n4. **Animate Suzanne's rotation** around the Z-axis over a 10-second timeline, creating a smooth continuous loop.\n5. **Implement a custom progress bar in the UI** that visually represents the progression of the animation rendering process, updating in real-time.\n6. **Utilize geometry nodes** to generate a layer of volumetric clouds in the background, with animated movement to simulate drifting clouds.\n7. **Set up an array of area lights** to illuminate the scene evenly, adjusting their intensity and color temperature for a natural lighting effect.\n8. **Incorporate a camera movement path** that circles around Suzanne, providing dynamic angles and perspectives throughout the animation.\n9. **Add a subtle ambient occlusion effect** to enhance the depth and realism of the shading on Suzanne and the surrounding environment.\n10. **Create a user interface panel** with controls to adjust the speed of Suzanne's rotation, the density of the volumetric clouds, and the intensity of the area lights, allowing real-time tweaking of these parameters during runtime.\n\nEnsure the script is well-structured, with clear comments explaining each section, and optimized for performance to handle real-time adjustments without significant lag. Every step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nAPPENDED USER ADDED CODE:\n\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Always use the `frame` keyword instead of `index` when inserting keyframes.\nExample: leg_bones[bone].keyframe_insert(data_path='rotation_euler', frame=frame)\n\n17. When setting the 'samples' property for 'ShaderNodeAmbientOcclusion', avoid using the dictionary-style access. For example, do not do this:\n```\nambient_occlusion.inputs['Samples'].default_value = 4\n```\nInstead, directly set the property using the dot notation:\n```\nambient_occlusion.samples = 4\n```\n\n18. Do not use `if not bpy.data.cameras` to check for camera existence, as this only verifies if camera data exists, not if a camera is present in the scene or set as active.\nInstead, check if the scene has an active camera using `if bpy.context.scene.camera is None`. If no active camera is present, create one and set it as active:\n```python\nif bpy.context.scene.camera is None:\n    # Create a new camera if none is active\n    bpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, 0, 10))\n    bpy.context.scene.camera = bpy.context.object  # Set the newly created camera as the active camera\n    print('No active camera found; created and set a new camera as active.')\nelse:\n    print('An active camera is already set in the scene.')\n```\nThis ensures the camera is correctly recognized by the render operation.\n\n19. If you encounter a 'poll() failed, context is incorrect' error when attempting to add a camera using `bpy.ops.object.camera_add`,\nthis is likely due to Blender not being in 'OBJECT' mode when the operator is called.\n\nTo resolve this, ensure that Blender is in 'OBJECT' mode before executing `camera_add`. Use the following steps to safely switch modes and add the camera:\n\n# Example fix for adding a camera\nif bpy.context.mode != 'OBJECT':\n    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')\nbpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, -5, 2))\n\n20. If you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "START OF USER REQUEST:\n\n#standard-boost\n\nCreate a Blender script that will:\n\n1. **Create a Suzanne (monkey head) mesh** at the center of the scene with a high polygon count.\n2. **Apply a toon shader** to Suzanne, customizing the shader with distinct color bands and edge outlines to achieve a cel-shaded effect.\n3. **Add a multiresolution modifier** to Suzanne, subdividing the mesh for detailed sculpting and ensuring it retains optimal performance.\n4. **Animate Suzanne's rotation** around the Z-axis over a 10-second timeline, creating a smooth continuous loop.\n5. **Implement a custom progress bar in the UI** that visually represents the progression of the animation rendering process, updating in real-time.\n6. **Utilize geometry nodes** to generate a layer of volumetric clouds in the background, with animated movement to simulate drifting clouds.\n7. **Set up an array of area lights** to illuminate the scene evenly, adjusting their intensity and color temperature for a natural lighting effect.\n8. **Incorporate a camera movement path** that circles around Suzanne, providing dynamic angles and perspectives throughout the animation.\n9. **Add a subtle ambient occlusion effect** to enhance the depth and realism of the shading on Suzanne and the surrounding environment.\n10. **Create a user interface panel** with controls to adjust the speed of Suzanne's rotation, the density of the volumetric clouds, and the intensity of the area lights, allowing real-time tweaking of these parameters during runtime.\n\nEnsure the script is well-structured, with clear comments explaining each section, and optimized for performance to handle real-time adjustments without significant lag. Every step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nAPPENDED USER ADDED CODE:\n\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Always use the `frame` keyword instead of `index` when inserting keyframes.\nExample: leg_bones[bone].keyframe_insert(data_path='rotation_euler', frame=frame)\n\n16. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n17. When setting the 'samples' property for 'ShaderNodeAmbientOcclusion', avoid using the dictionary-style access. For example, do not do this:\n```\nambient_occlusion.inputs['Samples'].default_value = 4\n```\nInstead, directly set the property using the dot notation:\n```\nambient_occlusion.samples = 4\n```\n\n18. Do not use `if not bpy.data.cameras` to check for camera existence, as this only verifies if camera data exists, not if a camera is present in the scene or set as active.\nInstead, check if the scene has an active camera using `if bpy.context.scene.camera is None`. If no active camera is present, create one and set it as active:\n```python\nif bpy.context.scene.camera is None:\n    # Create a new camera if none is active\n    bpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, 0, 10))\n    bpy.context.scene.camera = bpy.context.object  # Set the newly created camera as the active camera\n    print('No active camera found; created and set a new camera as active.')\nelse:\n    print('An active camera is already set in the scene.')\n```\nThis ensures the camera is correctly recognized by the render operation.\n\n19. If you encounter a 'poll() failed, context is incorrect' error when attempting to add a camera using `bpy.ops.object.camera_add`,\nthis is likely due to Blender not being in 'OBJECT' mode when the operator is called.\n\nTo resolve this, ensure that Blender is in 'OBJECT' mode before executing `camera_add`. Use the following steps to safely switch modes and add the camera:\n\n# Example fix for adding a camera\nif bpy.context.mode != 'OBJECT':\n    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')\nbpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, -5, 2))\n\n20.

Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10.

If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops.

Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. For procedural materials, connect the Emission shader to 'Surface' on Material Output. Ensure Transparent BSDF connects only to shader inputs for accurate effects.\n\n16. For accurate material effects in procedural creation, avoid connecting Transparent BSDF to the FAC input.

Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n20. If you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea. Because while `context.active_object` will show the currently active object, if you deselect all objects, it will still show the last active object:\n\n# What NOT to do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ngrid = bpy.context.object\n\n# What TO do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ndef get_active_object(context):\n    selected_objects = context.selected_objects\n    if selected_objects:\n        return context.active_object\n    return None\n\n21.

This modifier will allow you to apply node-based operations to the geometry of the Cube.\n\n2. **Set Up a New Geometry Nodes Node Tree**: Initialize a new node tree for the Geometry Nodes modifier. This node tree will serve as the workspace where you will add and connect various nodes to achieve the desired geometry manipulation.\n\n3. **Add a \"Point Distribute\" Node**: Insert a \"Point Distribute\" node into the node tree. This node will be responsible for controlling the distribution of points across the geometry, which in this case is the Cube. The distribution method can be set to either random or grid, depending on the desired effect.\n\n4. **Add a \"Mesh to Points\" Node**: Add a \"Mesh to Points\" node to the node tree. This node will convert the mesh of the Cube into a point cloud, which can then be used for further processing. Ensure that the mode is set to 'VERTICES' to create a point for each vertex of the Cube.\n\n5. **Connect Nodes**: Connect the output of the \"Mesh to Points\" node to the input of the \"Point Distribute\" node. This connection will allow the distributed points to be based on the vertices of the Cube.\n\n6. **Add a \"Point Instance\" Node**: Insert a \"Point Instance\" node into the node tree. This node will be used to instance the Cube at each of the distributed points, effectively creating multiple instances of the Cube.\n\n7. **Connect Nodes**: Connect the output of the \"Point Distribute\" node to the input of the \"Point Instance\" node. This connection will ensure that the instances are placed at the distributed points.\n\n8. **Set Instance Object**: Set the instance object in the \"Point Instance\" node to the Cube object. This step is crucial as it defines what geometry will be instanced at each point.\n\n9. **Add a \"Combine XYZ\" Node**: Add a \"Combine XYZ\" node to the node tree. This node will be used to control the position of the instances in the X and Y directions, allowing for precise placement of the instanced Cubes.\n\n10. **Connect Nodes**: Connect the output of the \"Combine XYZ\" node to the position input of the \"Point Instance\" node. This connection will allow the position of the instances to be controlled by the values set in the \"Combine XYZ\" node.\n\n11. **Set Values in \"Combine XYZ\" Node**: Define the values in the \"Combine XYZ\" node to determine how far apart the cubes will be in the X and Y directions. Adjust these values to achieve the desired spacing between the instances.\n\n12. **Apply the Geometry Nodes Modifier**: Ensure that the Geometry Nodes modifier is applied to the Cube object. This step finalizes the modifications and makes the changes permanent on the Cube's geometry.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual and API.\n\nAPPENDED USER ADDED CODE:\n\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n29. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n30. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n42. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what,as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nCreating a Blender script to add and configure a Geometry Nodes modifier on a Cube object.\n\nREASONING:\nThe task involves setting up a Geometry Nodes modifier with specific nodes and connections to manipulate the geometry of a Cube object.

Ensure that the Cube object is present and selected at the beginning of the script to avoid any missing object errors. Add a new Geometry Nodes modifier to this selected Cube object. This modifier will allow you to apply node-based operations to the geometry of the Cube.\n\n2. **Set Up a New Geometry Nodes Node Tree**: Initialize a new node tree for the Geometry Nodes modifier. This node tree will serve as the workspace where you will add and connect various nodes to achieve the desired geometry manipulation.\n\n3. **Add a \"Point Distribute\" Node**: Insert a \"Point Distribute\" node into the node tree. This node will be responsible for controlling the distribution of points across the geometry, which in this case is the Cube. The distribution method can be set to either random or grid, depending on the desired effect.\n\n4. **Add a \"Mesh to Points\" Node**: Add a \"Mesh to Points\" node to the node tree. This node will convert the mesh of the Cube into a point cloud, which can then be used for further processing. Ensure that the mode is set to 'VERTICES' to create a point for each vertex of the Cube.\n\n5. **Connect Nodes**: Connect the output of the \"Mesh to Points\" node to the input of the \"Point Distribute\" node. This connection will allow the distributed points to be based on the vertices of the Cube.\n\n6. **Add a \"Point Instance\" Node**: Insert a \"Point Instance\" node into the node tree.

This connection will ensure that the instances are placed at the distributed points.\n\n8. **Set Instance Object**: Set the instance object in the \"Point Instance\" node to the Cube object. This step is crucial as it defines what geometry will be instanced at each point.\n\n9. **Add a \"Combine XYZ\" Node**: Add a \"Combine XYZ\" node to the node tree. This node will be used to control the position of the instances in the X and Y directions, allowing for precise placement of the instanced Cubes.\n\n10. **Connect Nodes**: Connect the output of the \"Combine XYZ\" node to the position input of the \"Point Instance\" node.

Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n    # Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\n    colour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n    # New method in Blender 4.3+:\n    colour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n    # Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \n    try:\n        # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n        if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n            viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n        if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n            viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18. If you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "START OF USER REQUEST:\n\n#advanced-boost\n\nCreate a Blender script that will:\n\n1. **Ensure the Cube Object is Present and Selected**: Begin by checking if a Cube object exists in the current Blender scene. If it does not exist, create a new Cube object. This step is crucial to prevent any errors related to missing objects when adding the Geometry Nodes modifier. Once the Cube is confirmed to exist, select it to make it the active object. This ensures that all subsequent operations are applied to the correct object.\n\n2. **Add a New Geometry Nodes Modifier**: With the Cube object selected, add a new Geometry Nodes modifier. This modifier is essential for performing node-based operations on the Cube's geometry, allowing for advanced manipulation and effects.\n\n3. **Initialize a New Geometry Nodes Node Tree**: Set up a new node tree for the Geometry Nodes modifier. This node tree will serve as the workspace where various nodes will be added and connected to achieve the desired geometry manipulation.\n\n4. **Insert a \"Point Distribute\" Node**: Add a \"Point Distribute\" node to the node tree. This node is responsible for controlling the distribution of points across the Cube's geometry. Choose a distribution method, such as random or grid, based on the desired effect.\n\n5. **Add a \"Mesh to Points\" Node**: Include a \"Mesh to Points\" node in the node tree. This node will convert the Cube's mesh into a point cloud. Set the mode to 'VERTICES' to create a point for each vertex of the Cube, which will be used for further processing.\n\n6. **Connect the \"Mesh to Points\" Node to the \"Point Distribute\" Node**: Establish a connection between the output of the \"Mesh to Points\" node and the input of the \"Point Distribute\" node. This connection ensures that the distributed points are based on the Cube's vertices.\n\n7. **Insert a \"Point Instance\" Node**: Add a \"Point Instance\" node to the node tree. This node will be responsible for instancing the Cube at each of the distributed points, effectively creating multiple instances of the Cube.\n\n8. **Connect the \"Point Distribute\" Node to the \"Point Instance\" Node**: Connect the output of the \"Point Distribute\" node to the input of the \"Point Instance\" node. This connection ensures that the instances are placed at the distributed points.\n\n9. **Set the Instance Object in the \"Point Instance\" Node**: Define the instance object in the \"Point Instance\" node as the Cube object. This step is crucial as it specifies the geometry that will be instanced at each point.\n\n10. **Add a \"Combine XYZ\" Node**: Insert a \"Combine XYZ\" node into the node tree. This node will be used to control the position of the instances in the X and Y directions, allowing for precise placement of the instanced Cubes.\n\n11. **Connect the \"Combine XYZ\" Node to the \"Point Instance\" Node**: Connect the output of the \"Combine XYZ\" node to the position input of the \"Point Instance\" node. This connection allows the position of the instances to be controlled by the values set in the \"Combine XYZ\" node.\n\n12. **Define Values in the \"Combine XYZ\" Node**: Set the values in the \"Combine XYZ\" node to determine the spacing between the cubes in the X and Y directions. Adjust these values to achieve the desired spacing between the instances.\n\n13. **Apply the Geometry Nodes Modifier**: Ensure that the Geometry Nodes modifier is applied to the Cube object. This step finalizes the modifications and makes the changes permanent on the Cube's geometry.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual and API.\n\nAPPENDED USER ADDED CODE:\n\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18. If you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea. Because while `context.active_object` will show the currently active object, if you deselect all objects, it will still show the last active object:\n\n# What NOT to do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ngrid = bpy.context.object\n\n# What TO do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ndef get_active_object(context):\n    selected_objects = context.selected_objects\n    if selected_objects:\n        return context.active_object\n    return None\n\n19.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "START OF USER REQUEST:\n\n#advanced-boost\n\nCreate a Blender script that will:\n\n1. **Ensure the Cube Object is Present and Selected**: Start by checking if a Cube object exists in the current Blender scene. If it does not exist, create a new Cube object. This step is crucial to prevent any errors related to missing objects when adding the Geometry Nodes modifier. Once the Cube is confirmed to exist, select it to make it the active object. This ensures that all subsequent operations are applied to the correct object.\n\n2. **Add a New Geometry Nodes Modifier**: With the Cube object selected, add a new Geometry Nodes modifier. This modifier is essential for performing node-based operations on the Cube's geometry, allowing for advanced manipulation and effects.\n\n3. **Initialize a New Geometry Nodes Node Tree**: Set up a new node tree for the Geometry Nodes modifier. This node tree will serve as the workspace where various nodes will be added and connected to achieve the desired geometry manipulation.\n\n4. **Insert a \"Point Distribute\" Node**: Add a \"Point Distribute\" node to the node tree. This node is responsible for controlling the distribution of points across the Cube's geometry. Choose a distribution method, such as random or grid, based on the desired effect.\n\n5. **Add a \"Mesh to Points\" Node**: Include a \"Mesh to Points\" node in the node tree. This node will convert the Cube's mesh into a point cloud. Set the mode to 'VERTICES' to create a point for each vertex of the Cube, which will be used for further processing.\n\n6. **Connect the \"Mesh to Points\" Node to the \"Point Distribute\" Node**: Establish a connection between the output of the \"Mesh to Points\" node and the input of the \"Point Distribute\" node. This connection ensures that the distributed points are based on the Cube's vertices.\n\n7. **Insert a \"Point Instance\" Node**: Add a \"Point Instance\" node to the node tree. This node will be responsible for instancing the Cube at each of the distributed points, effectively creating multiple instances of the Cube.\n\n8. **Connect the \"Point Distribute\" Node to the \"Point Instance\" Node**: Connect the output of the \"Point Distribute\" node to the input of the \"Point Instance\" node. This connection ensures that the instances are placed at the distributed points.\n\n9. **Set the Instance Object in the \"Point Instance\" Node**: Define the instance object in the \"Point Instance\" node as the Cube object. This step is crucial as it specifies the geometry that will be instanced at each point.\n\n10. **Add a \"Combine XYZ\" Node**: Insert a \"Combine XYZ\" node into the node tree. This node will be used to control the position of the instances in the X and Y directions, allowing for precise placement of the instanced Cubes.\n\n11. **Connect the \"Combine XYZ\" Node to the \"Point Instance\" Node**: Connect the output of the \"Combine XYZ\" node to the position input of the \"Point Instance\" node. This connection allows the position of the instances to be controlled by the values set in the \"Combine XYZ\" node.\n\n12. **Define Values in the \"Combine XYZ\" Node**: Set the values in the \"Combine XYZ\" node to determine the spacing between the cubes in the X and Y directions. Adjust these values to achieve the desired spacing between the instances.\n\n13. **Apply the Geometry Nodes Modifier**: Ensure that the Geometry Nodes modifier is applied to the Cube object. This step finalizes the modifications and makes the changes permanent on the Cube's geometry.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual and API.\n\nAPPENDED USER ADDED CODE:\n\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n    # Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\n    colour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n    # New method in Blender 4.3+:\n    colour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n    # Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \n    try:\n        # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n        if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n            viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n        if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n            viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18. If you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea. Because while `context.active_object` will show the currently active object, if you deselect all objects, it will still show the last active object:\n\n    # What NOT to do:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\n    grid = bpy.context.object\n\n    # What TO do:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\n    def get_active_object(context):\n        selected_objects = context.selected_objects\n        if selected_objects:\n            return context.active_object\n        return None\n\n19. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what, as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nCreating a Blender script to manipulate a Cube object using Geometry Nodes.\n\nREASONING:\nThe script needs to ensure a Cube object is present, add a Geometry Nodes modifier, and set up a node tree with specific nodes connected in a particular order.\n\nPLAN:\n- Check for the existence of a Cube object\n- Add a Geometry Nodes modifier\n- Set up a node tree with specific nodes\n- Connect nodes appropriately\n- Apply the modifier\n\nCRITICISM:\nEnsure all nodes are correctly connected and the script handles errors gracefully.\n\nCODE:\n\n```python\nimport bpy\nimport traceback\n\n# Function to ensure a Cube object is present and selected\ndef ensure_cube_exists():\n    try:\n        # Check if a Cube object exists\n        cube = None\n        for obj in bpy.data.objects:\n            if obj.type == 'MESH' and obj.name.startswith('Cube'):\n                cube = obj\n                break\n        \n        # If no Cube exists, create one\n        if not cube:\n            bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n            cube = bpy.context.active_object\n        \n        # Select the Cube\n        bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='DESELECT')\n        cube.select_set(True)\n        bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = cube\n        return cube\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"\\nError: Failed to ensure Cube exists\")\n        traceback.print_exc()\n\n# Function to add a Geometry Nodes modifier and set up the node tree\ndef setup_geometry_nodes(cube):\n    try:\n        # Add Geometry Nodes modifier\n        geo_nodes_mod = cube.modifiers.new(name='GeometryNodes', type='NODES')\n        \n        # Create a new node tree\n        node_tree = bpy.data.node_groups.new(name='GeometryNodesTree', type='GeometryNodeTree')\n        geo_nodes_mod.node_group = node_tree\n        \n        # Add nodes\n        input_node = node_tree.nodes.new(type='NodeGroupInput')\n        output_node = node_tree.nodes.new(type='NodeGroupOutput')\n        mesh_to_points_node = node_tree.nodes.new(type='GeometryNodeMeshToPoints')\n        point_distribute_node = node_tree.nodes.new(type='GeometryNodePointDistribute')\n        point_instance_node = node_tree.nodes.new(type='GeometryNodePointInstance')\n        combine_xyz_node = node_tree.nodes.new(type='ShaderNodeCombineXYZ')\n        \n        # Connect nodes\n        node_tree.links.new(input_node.outputs['Geometry'], mesh_to_points_node.inputs['Mesh'])\n        node_tree.links.new(mesh_to_points_node.outputs['Points'], point_distribute_node.inputs['Points'])\n        node_tree.links.new(point_distribute_node.outputs['Points'], point_instance_node.inputs['Points'])\n        node_tree.links.new(combine_xyz_node.outputs['Vector'], point_instance_node.inputs['Position'])\n        node_tree.links.new(point_instance_node.outputs['Geometry'], output_node.inputs['Geometry'])\n        \n        # Set node properties\n        mesh_to_points_node.mode = 'VERTICES'\n        point_instance_node.inputs['Instance'].default_value = cube\n        combine_xyz_node.inputs['X'].default_value = 1.0\n        combine_xyz_node.inputs['Y'].default_value = 1.0\n        \n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"\\nError: Failed to set up Geometry Nodes\")\n        traceback.print_exc()\n\n# Main function to execute the script\ndef main():\n    cube = ensure_cube_exists()\n    if cube:\n        setup_geometry_nodes(cube)\n\n# Execute the main function\nmain()\n```\n\nREPEATED_ERROR:\nThere might be an error in node connections or setting default values.

If it does not exist, create a new Cube object. This step is crucial to prevent any errors related to missing objects when adding the Geometry Nodes modifier. Once the Cube is confirmed to exist, select it to make it the active object. This ensures that all subsequent operations are applied to the correct object.\n\n2. **Add a New Geometry Nodes Modifier**: With the Cube object selected, add a new Geometry Nodes modifier. This modifier is essential for performing node-based operations on the Cube's geometry, allowing for advanced manipulation and effects.\n\n3. **Initialize a New Geometry Nodes Node Tree**: Set up a new node tree for the Geometry Nodes modifier. This node tree will serve as the workspace where various nodes will be added and connected to achieve the desired geometry manipulation.\n\n4. **Insert a \"Point Distribute\" Node**: Add a \"Point Distribute\" node to the node tree. This node is responsible for controlling the distribution of points across the Cube's geometry. Choose a distribution method, such as random or grid, based on the desired effect.\n\n5. **Add a \"Mesh to Points\" Node**: Include a \"Mesh to Points\" node in the node tree. This node will convert the Cube's mesh into a point cloud. Set the mode to 'VERTICES' to create a point for each vertex of the Cube, which will be used for further processing.\n\n6. **Connect the \"Mesh to Points\" Node to the \"Point Distribute\" Node**: Establish a connection between the output of the \"Mesh to Points\" node and the input of the \"Point Distribute\" node. This connection ensures that the distributed points are based on the Cube's vertices.\n\n7. **Insert a \"Point Instance\" Node**: Add a \"Point Instance\" node to the node tree. This node will be responsible for instancing the Cube at each of the distributed points, effectively creating multiple instances of the Cube.\n\n8. **Connect the \"Point Distribute\" Node to the \"Point Instance\" Node**: Connect the output of the \"Point Distribute\" node to the input of the \"Point Instance\" node. This connection ensures that the instances are placed at the distributed points.\n\n9. **Set the Instance Object in the \"Point Instance\" Node**: Define the instance object in the \"Point Instance\" node as the Cube object. This step is crucial as it specifies the geometry that will be instanced at each point.\n\n10. **Add a \"Combine XYZ\" Node**: Insert a \"Combine XYZ\" node into the node tree. This node will be used to control the position of the instances in the X and Y directions, allowing for precise placement of the instanced Cubes.\n\n11. **Connect the \"Combine XYZ\" Node to the \"Point Instance\" Node**: Connect the output of the \"Combine XYZ\" node to the position input of the \"Point Instance\" node. This connection allows the position of the instances to be controlled by the values set in the \"Combine XYZ\" node.\n\n12. **Define Values in the \"Combine XYZ\" Node**: Set the values in the \"Combine XYZ\" node to determine the spacing between the cubes in the X and Y directions. Adjust these values to achieve the desired spacing between the instances.\n\n13. **Apply the Geometry Nodes Modifier**: Ensure that the Geometry Nodes modifier is applied to the Cube object.

If it does not exist, create a new Cube object. This step is crucial to prevent any errors related to missing objects when adding the Geometry Nodes modifier. Once the Cube is confirmed to exist, select it to make it the active object. This ensures that all subsequent operations are applied to the correct object.\n\n2. **Add a New Geometry Nodes Modifier**: With the Cube object selected, add a new Geometry Nodes modifier. This modifier is essential for performing node-based operations on the Cube's geometry, allowing for advanced manipulation and effects.\n\n3. **Initialize a New Geometry Nodes Node Tree**: Set up a new node tree for the Geometry Nodes modifier. This node tree will serve as the workspace where various nodes will be added and connected to achieve the desired geometry manipulation.\n\n4. **Insert a \"Point Distribute\" Node**: Add a \"Point Distribute\" node to the node tree. This node is responsible for controlling the distribution of points across the Cube's geometry. Choose a distribution method, such as random or grid, based on the desired effect.\n\n5. **Add a \"Mesh to Points\" Node**: Include a \"Mesh to Points\" node in the node tree. This node will convert the Cube's mesh into a point cloud. Set the mode to 'VERTICES' to create a point for each vertex of the Cube, which will be used for further processing.\n\n6. **Connect the \"Mesh to Points\" Node to the \"Point Distribute\" Node**: Establish a connection between the output of the \"Mesh to Points\" node and the input of the \"Point Distribute\" node. This connection ensures that the distributed points are based on the Cube's vertices.\n\n7. **Insert a \"Point Instance\" Node**: Add a \"Point Instance\" node to the node tree. This node will be responsible for instancing the Cube at each of the distributed points, effectively creating multiple instances of the Cube.\n\n8. **Connect the \"Point Distribute\" Node to the \"Point Instance\" Node**: Connect the output of the \"Point Distribute\" node to the input of the \"Point Instance\" node. This connection ensures that the instances are placed at the distributed points.\n\n9. **Set the Instance Object in the \"Point Instance\" Node**: Define the instance object in the \"Point Instance\" node as the Cube object.

Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n    # Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\n    colour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n    # New method in Blender 4.3+:\n    colour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n    # Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \n    try:\n        # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n        if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n            viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n        if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n            viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18. If you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "START OF USER REQUEST:\n\n#advanced-boost\n\nCreate a Blender script that will:\n\n1. **Ensure the Cube Object is Present and Selected**: Start by checking if a Cube object exists in the current Blender scene. If it does not exist, create a new Cube object. This step is crucial to prevent any errors related to missing objects when adding the Geometry Nodes modifier. Once the Cube is confirmed to exist, select it to make it the active object. This ensures that all subsequent operations are applied to the correct object.\n\n2. **Add a New Geometry Nodes Modifier**: With the Cube object selected, add a new Geometry Nodes modifier. This modifier is essential for performing node-based operations on the Cube's geometry, allowing for advanced manipulation and effects.\n\n3. **Initialize a New Geometry Nodes Node Tree**: Set up a new node tree for the Geometry Nodes modifier. This node tree will serve as the workspace where various nodes will be added and connected to achieve the desired geometry manipulation.\n\n4. **Insert a \"Point Distribute\" Node**: Add a \"Point Distribute\" node to the node tree. This node is responsible for controlling the distribution of points across the Cube's geometry. Choose a distribution method, such as random or grid, based on the desired effect.\n\n5. **Add a \"Mesh to Points\" Node**: Include a \"Mesh to Points\" node in the node tree. This node will convert the Cube's mesh into a point cloud. Set the mode to 'VERTICES' to create a point for each vertex of the Cube, which will be used for further processing.\n\n6. **Connect the \"Mesh to Points\" Node to the \"Point Distribute\" Node**: Establish a connection between the output of the \"Mesh to Points\" node and the input of the \"Point Distribute\" node. This connection ensures that the distributed points are based on the Cube's vertices.\n\n7. **Insert a \"Point Instance\" Node**: Add a \"Point Instance\" node to the node tree. This node will be responsible for instancing the Cube at each of the distributed points, effectively creating multiple instances of the Cube.\n\n8. **Connect the \"Point Distribute\" Node to the \"Point Instance\" Node**: Connect the output of the \"Point Distribute\" node to the input of the \"Point Instance\" node. This connection ensures that the instances are placed at the distributed points.\n\n9. **Set the Instance Object in the \"Point Instance\" Node**: Define the instance object in the \"Point Instance\" node as the Cube object. This step is crucial as it specifies the geometry that will be instanced at each point.\n\n10. **Add a \"Combine XYZ\" Node**: Insert a \"Combine XYZ\" node into the node tree. This node will be used to control the position of the instances in the X and Y directions, allowing for precise placement of the instanced Cubes.\n\n11. **Connect the \"Combine XYZ\" Node to the \"Point Instance\" Node**: Connect the output of the \"Combine XYZ\" node to the position input of the \"Point Instance\" node. This connection allows the position of the instances to be controlled by the values set in the \"Combine XYZ\" node.\n\n12. **Define Values in the \"Combine XYZ\" Node**: Set the values in the \"Combine XYZ\" node to determine the spacing between the cubes in the X and Y directions. Adjust these values to achieve the desired spacing between the instances.\n\n13. **Apply the Geometry Nodes Modifier**: Ensure that the Geometry Nodes modifier is applied to the Cube object. This step finalizes the modifications and makes the changes permanent on the Cube's geometry.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual and API.\n\nAPPENDED USER ADDED CODE:\n\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n    # Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\n    colour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n    # New method in Blender 4.3+:\n    colour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n    # Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \n    try:\n        # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n        if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n            viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n        if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n            viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18. If you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea. Because while `context.active_object` will show the currently active object, if you deselect all objects, it will still show the last active object:\n\n    # What NOT to do:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\n    grid = bpy.context.object\n\n    # What TO do:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\n    def get_active_object(context):\n        selected_objects = context.selected_objects\n        if selected_objects:\n            return context.active_object\n        return None\n\n19.

If it does not exist, create a new Cube object. This step is crucial to prevent any errors related to missing objects when adding the Geometry Nodes modifier. Once the Cube is confirmed to exist, select it to make it the active object. This ensures that all subsequent operations are applied to the correct object.\n\n2. **Add a New Geometry Nodes Modifier**: With the Cube object selected, add a new Geometry Nodes modifier. This modifier is essential for performing node-based operations on the Cube's geometry, allowing for advanced manipulation and effects.\n\n3. **Initialize a New Geometry Nodes Node Tree**: Set up a new node tree for the Geometry Nodes modifier. This node tree will serve as the workspace where various nodes will be added and connected to achieve the desired geometry manipulation.\n\n4. **Insert a \"Point Distribute\" Node**: Add a \"Point Distribute\" node to the node tree. This node is responsible for controlling the distribution of points across the Cube's geometry. Choose a distribution method, such as random or grid, based on the desired effect.\n\n5. **Add a \"Mesh to Points\" Node**: Include a \"Mesh to Points\" node in the node tree. This node will convert the Cube's mesh into a point cloud. Set the mode to 'VERTICES' to create a point for each vertex of the Cube, which will be used for further processing.\n\n6. **Connect the \"Mesh to Points\" Node to the \"Point Distribute\" Node**: Establish a connection between the output of the \"Mesh to Points\" node and the input of the \"Point Distribute\" node. This connection ensures that the distributed points are based on the Cube's vertices.\n\n7. **Insert a \"Point Instance\" Node**: Add a \"Point Instance\" node to the node tree. This node will be responsible for instancing the Cube at each of the distributed points, effectively creating multiple instances of the Cube.\n\n8. **Connect the \"Point Distribute\" Node to the \"Point Instance\" Node**: Connect the output of the \"Point Distribute\" node to the input of the \"Point Instance\" node. This connection ensures that the instances are placed at the distributed points.\n\n9. **Set the Instance Object in the \"Point Instance\" Node**: Define the instance object in the \"Point Instance\" node as the Cube object. This step is crucial as it specifies the geometry that will be instanced at each point.\n\n10. **Add a \"Combine XYZ\" Node**: Insert a \"Combine XYZ\" node into the node tree. This node will be used to control the position of the instances in the X and Y directions, allowing for precise placement of the instanced Cubes.\n\n11. **Connect the \"Combine XYZ\" Node to the \"Point Instance\" Node**: Connect the output of the \"Combine XYZ\" node to the position input of the \"Point Instance\" node. This connection allows the position of the instances to be controlled by the values set in the \"Combine XYZ\" node.\n\n12. **Define Values in the \"Combine XYZ\" Node**: Set the values in the \"Combine XYZ\" node to determine the spacing between the cubes in the X and Y directions. Adjust these values to achieve the desired spacing between the instances.\n\n13. **Apply the Geometry Nodes Modifier**: Ensure that the Geometry Nodes modifier is applied to the Cube object.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "START OF USER REQUEST:\n\n#standard-boost\n\nCreate a Blender script that will:\n\n1. Create a torus mesh positioned at the origin with a major radius of 1 and a minor radius of 0.4.\n2. Apply a glass shader to the torus, setting appropriate transparency, refraction, and reflection properties to achieve realistic glass material effects.\n3. Add a Mirror Modifier to the torus with default settings to enhance its reflective surface.\n4. Generate a plane beneath the torus and enable cloth physics on it, configuring the mass, stiffness, and damping parameters for realistic cloth simulation.\n5. Create a custom UI panel in the Blender interface that includes a slider allowing users to adjust the cloth simulation's gravity strength in real-time.\n6. Utilize Geometry Nodes on the cloth plane to create an animated wave effect, controlling the wave amplitude and frequency over time to simulate natural movement.\n7. Set up an HDRI environment texture for scene lighting by importing a high-quality HDRI file and applying it to the world background for realistic illumination and reflections.\n8. Position and configure a camera to frame the torus and cloth plane optimally, including setting focal length and depth of field to highlight the interaction between objects.\n9. Animate the torus to rotate continuously around its vertical axis, adding keyframes to ensure smooth and perpetual motion throughout the animation timeline.\n10. Configure the rendering settings for high-quality output, including resolution, sampling rates, and output format, then execute the render process and save the final animation to a designated directory.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. If attempting to enable mesh mirroring, do not use `ToolSettings` for the `use_mesh_mirror_x` attribute. In the latest version of Blender (4.3), this attribute is no longer available in `ToolSettings`. Instead, access it directly through the object's mesh data, like this: `bpy.data.objects['House'].data.use_mirror_x = True`.\n\n16. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n17. Do not use `if not bpy.data.cameras` to check for camera existence, as this only verifies if camera data exists, not if a camera is present in the scene or set as active. Instead, check if the scene has an active camera using `if bpy.context.scene.camera is None`. If no active camera is present, create one and set it as active:\n```python\nif bpy.context.scene.camera is None:\n    # Create a new camera if none is active\n    bpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, 0, 10))\n    bpy.context.scene.camera = bpy.context.object  # Set the newly created camera as the active camera\n    print('No active camera found; created and set a new camera as active.')\nelse:\n    print('An active camera is already set in the scene.')\n```\nThis ensures the camera is correctly recognized by the render operation.\n\n18. If you encounter a 'poll() failed, context is incorrect' error when attempting to add a camera using `bpy.ops.object.camera_add`, this is likely due to Blender not being in 'OBJECT' mode when the operator is called. To resolve this, ensure that Blender is in 'OBJECT' mode before executing `camera_add`. Use the following steps to safely switch modes and add the camera:\n\n# Example fix for adding a camera\nif bpy.context.mode != 'OBJECT':\n    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')\nbpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, -5, 2))\n\n19. When adding a cloth modifier to an object, ensure that the object has at least **48 subdivisions** for realistic cloth deformation. Position the cloth object, such as a plane, **above** the target object it will interact with to enable a natural fall. Add a collision modifier to the target object (e.g., torus) so the cloth will collide with it as it falls. Use the following to add a collision modifier: `bpy.ops.object.modifier_add(type='COLLISION')` Note: Both cloth and collision modifiers can be found under the **Physics Properties** tab. With these settings, pressing 'play' will activate the cloth simulation, allowing the cloth to fall and interact correctly with the target.\n\n20. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what, as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nCreating a Blender script to generate a torus with a glass shader, apply a mirror modifier, add a cloth plane with physics, and set up a custom UI panel for gravity adjustment.\n\nREASONING:\nThe script needs to follow a structured approach to ensure all elements are correctly created and configured.

Here are the detailed steps I need to follow:\n\n1. **Set Up the Scene**: Start by opening Blender and setting up a new project. Ensure that the default cube is present in the scene. If not, add a cube by using the `Add` menu or by pressing `Shift + A` and selecting `Mesh > Cube`.\n\n2. **Create the Base of the House**: Use the default cube as the base of the house. Scale it to the desired size using the `S` key. For a low poly look, keep the scaling simple and avoid adding too many subdivisions.\n\n3. **Add a Roof**: To create a roof, add a new mesh object, such as a cone or a pyramid. Use `Shift + A` to add a `Mesh > Cone`. Adjust the number of vertices to a low count (e.g., 4) to maintain the low poly style. Position the cone on top of the cube to form the roof.\n\n4. **Create Windows and Doors**: Add smaller cubes to represent windows and doors. Use `Shift + A` to add `Mesh > Cube` and scale them down. Position these cubes on the walls of the house. For a low poly style, keep the shapes simple and avoid excessive detail.\n\n5. **Join the Meshes**: Once the basic shapes are in place, join all the meshes into a single object. Select all the objects and press `Ctrl + J` to join them. This will make it easier to manage the house as a single entity.\n\n6. **Apply Materials**: Assign basic materials to different parts of the house. Use simple colors to differentiate the roof, walls, windows, and doors. Access the materials tab in the properties panel and create new materials as needed.\n\n7. **Adjust the Lighting**: Set up basic lighting to enhance the appearance of the house. Use a sun lamp for general lighting and adjust its position and strength to achieve the desired effect.\n\n8. **Set Up the Camera**: Position the camera to capture the house from a flattering angle. Use the `N` panel to adjust the camera's location and rotation. Ensure the house is centered in the frame.\n\n9. **Render the Scene**: Once everything is set up, render the scene to see the final result. Use `F12` to render the image. Adjust render settings as needed to achieve the desired quality.\n\n10. **Save the Project**: Save the Blender project file to preserve the work. Use `File > Save As` to choose a location and file name.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual and API.\n\nAPPENDED USER ADDED CODE:\n\n\n# These are well-tested examples of how to write specific functionality you may need.\n\nThe examples provided are pulled from a rigorously tested database, representing the definitive way to implement specific functions, properties, and operators.

Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. If attempting to enable mesh mirroring, do not use `ToolSettings` for the `use_mesh_mirror_x` attribute. In the latest version of Blender (4.3), this attribute is no longer available in `ToolSettings`. Instead, access it directly through the object's mesh data, like this: `bpy.data.objects['House'].data.use_mirror_x = True`.\n\n16. If attempting to use 'mesh_extrude' via ToolSettings, do not use ToolSettings for the 'mesh_extrude' attribute. In the latest version of Blender (4.3), this attribute is no longer available in ToolSettings, causing an error. Instead, achieve extrusion along normals by using the following steps: bpy.ops.mesh.extrude_region_move(TRANSFORM_OT_translate={\"orient_type\": 'NORMAL', \"orient_matrix_type\": 'NORMAL', \"constraint_axis\": (False, False, True), \"value\": (0, 0, 1)}). If you need an even offset effect, apply an inset operation after extrusion like this: bpy.ops.mesh.inset(use_even_offset=True, thickness=0.1).\n\n17. Vertices, edges, and faces in Blender are measured from the object's origin point, initially set at the object's geometric center. For instance, the default cube has an origin point at (0, 0, 0), with a height of 2 meters. The topmost vertex starts at 1 meter in the Z direction. If the origin point is moved, the vertex, edge, and face locations still reference the origin point relative to the geometry.\n\n18. In Blender, the assistant should never guess the location of vertices, edges, or faces while in edit mode. Instead, locations must always be derived programmatically by iterating over the geometry data, such as finding vertex positions dynamically using properties like coordinates (v.co). For example, to determine the topmost vertices of an object, calculate the maximum value for the z-coordinate and select vertices matching that value programmatically, ensuring accuracy without assumptions.\n\n19. Do not use `if not bpy.data.cameras` to check for camera existence, as this only verifies if camera data exists, not if a camera is present in the scene or set as active. Instead, check if the scene has an active camera using `if bpy.context.scene.camera is None`. If no active camera is present, create one and set it as active:\n```python\nif bpy.context.scene.camera is None:\n    # Create a new camera if none is active\n    bpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, 0, 10))\n    bpy.context.scene.camera = bpy.context.object  # Set the newly created camera as the active camera\n    print('No active camera found; created and set a new camera as active.')\nelse:\n    print('An active camera is already set in the scene.')\n```\nThis ensures the camera is correctly recognized by the render operation.\n\n20. If you encounter a 'poll() failed, context is incorrect' error when attempting to add a camera using `bpy.ops.object.camera_add`, this is likely due to Blender not being in 'OBJECT' mode when the operator is called. To resolve this, ensure that Blender is in 'OBJECT' mode before executing `camera_add`. Use the following steps to safely switch modes and add the camera:\n```python\n# Example fix for adding a camera\nif bpy.context.mode != 'OBJECT':\n    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')\nbpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, -5, 2))\n```\n\n21. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what, as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nCreating a Blender script to guide through modeling a low poly house involves setting up the scene, creating the base, adding a roof, windows, and doors, joining meshes, applying materials, adjusting lighting, setting up the camera, rendering, and saving the project.\n\nREASONING:\nThe script needs to follow the detailed steps provided by the user, ensuring that each step is executed correctly in Blender 4.3.

If not, add a cube by using the `Add` menu or by pressing `Shift + A` and selecting `Mesh > Cube`.\n\n2. **Create the Base of the House**: Use the default cube as the base of the house. Scale it to the desired size using the `S` key. For a low poly look, keep the scaling simple and avoid adding too many subdivisions.\n\n3. **Add a Roof**: To create a roof, add a new mesh object, such as a cone or a pyramid. Use `Shift + A` to add a `Mesh > Cone`. Adjust the number of vertices to a low count (e.g., 4) to maintain the low poly style. Position the cone on top of the cube to form the roof.\n\n4. **Create Windows and Doors**: Add smaller cubes to represent windows and doors. Use `Shift + A` to add `Mesh > Cube` and scale them down. Position these cubes on the walls of the house.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "START OF USER REQUEST:\n\n#advanced-boost\n\nCreate a Blender script that will guide me through the process of modeling a low poly house. Here are the detailed steps I need to follow:\n\n1. **Set Up the Scene**: Start by opening Blender and setting up a new project. Ensure that the default cube is present in the scene. If not, add a cube by using the `Add` menu or by pressing `Shift + A` and selecting `Mesh > Cube`.\n\n2. **Create the Base of the House**: Use the default cube as the base of the house. Scale it to the desired size using the `S` key. For a low poly look, keep the scaling simple and avoid adding too many subdivisions.\n\n3. **Add a Roof**: To create a roof, add a new mesh object, such as a cone or a pyramid. Use `Shift + A` to add a `Mesh > Cone`. Adjust the number of vertices to a low count (e.g., 4) to maintain the low poly style. Position the cone on top of the cube to form the roof.\n\n4. **Create Windows and Doors**: Add smaller cubes to represent windows and doors. Use `Shift + A` to add `Mesh > Cube` and scale them down. Position these cubes on the walls of the house. For a low poly style, keep the shapes simple and avoid excessive detail.\n\n5. **Join the Meshes**: Once the basic shapes are in place, join all the meshes into a single object. Select all the objects and press `Ctrl + J` to join them. This will make it easier to manage the house as a single entity.\n\n6. **Apply Materials**: Assign basic materials to different parts of the house. Use simple colors to differentiate the roof, walls, windows, and doors. Access the materials tab in the properties panel and create new materials as needed.\n\n7. **Adjust the Lighting**: Set up basic lighting to enhance the appearance of the house. Use a sun lamp for general lighting and adjust its position and strength to achieve the desired effect.\n\n8. **Set Up the Camera**: Position the camera to capture the house from a flattering angle. Use the `N` panel to adjust the camera's location and rotation. Ensure the house is centered in the frame.\n\n9. **Render the Scene**: Once everything is set up, render the scene to see the final result. Use `F12` to render the image. Adjust render settings as needed to achieve the desired quality.\n\n10. **Save the Project**: Save the Blender project file to preserve the work. Use `File > Save As` to choose a location and file name.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual and API.\n\nAPPENDED USER ADDED CODE:\n\n\n# These are well-tested examples of how to write specific functionality you may need.\n\nThe examples provided are pulled from a rigorously tested database, representing the definitive way to implement specific functions, properties, and operators.

Here are the detailed steps I need to follow:\n\n1. **Set Up the Scene**: Start by opening Blender and setting up a new project. Ensure that the default cube is present in the scene. If not, add a cube by using the `Add` menu or by pressing `Shift + A` and selecting `Mesh > Cube`.\n\n2. **Create the Base of the House**: Use the default cube as the base of the house. Scale it to the desired size using the `S` key. For a low poly look, keep the scaling simple and avoid adding too many subdivisions.\n\n3. **Add a Roof**: To create a roof, add a new mesh object, such as a cone or a pyramid. Use `Shift + A` to add a `Mesh > Cone`. Adjust the number of vertices to a low count (e.g., 4) to maintain the low poly style. Position the cone on top of the cube to form the roof.\n\n4. **Create Windows and Doors**: Add smaller cubes to represent windows and doors. Use `Shift + A` to add `Mesh > Cube` and scale them down. Position these cubes on the walls of the house. For a low poly style, keep the shapes simple and avoid excessive detail.\n\n5. **Join the Meshes**: Once the basic shapes are in place, join all the meshes into a single object. Select all the objects and press `Ctrl + J` to join them. This will make it easier to manage the house as a single entity.\n\n6. **Apply Materials**: Assign basic materials to different parts of the house. Use simple colors to differentiate the roof, walls, windows, and doors. Access the materials tab in the properties panel and create new materials as needed.\n\n7. **Adjust the Lighting**: Set up basic lighting to enhance the appearance of the house. Use a sun lamp for general lighting and adjust its position and strength to achieve the desired effect.\n\n8. **Set Up the Camera**: Position the camera to capture the house from a flattering angle. Use the `N` panel to adjust the camera's location and rotation. Ensure the house is centered in the frame.\n\n9. **Render the Scene**: Once everything is set up, render the scene to see the final result. Use `F12` to render the image. Adjust render settings as needed to achieve the desired quality.\n\n10. **Save the Project**: Save the Blender project file to preserve the work. Use `File > Save As` to choose a location and file name.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual and API.\n\nAPPENDED USER ADDED CODE:\n\n\n# These are well-tested examples of how to write specific functionality you may need.\n\nThe examples provided are pulled from a rigorously tested database, representing the definitive way to implement specific functions, properties, and operators.

Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n29. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n30. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n42.

Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n29. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n30. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n42.

Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18.

Initially, the simulation engine runs and outputs a .txt file, sim_log.txt, containing the details to be processed by the script on Blender. Then, we run the script and get a visualization of the traffic flow.\nSometimes, I could not really figure out why, the Blender script throws the following exception when trying to read the output file which is in the same directory with the .blender file:\nInfo: Deleted 0 object(s)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\\\BlenderTest\\\\CS402\\\\SimulationAnimator.blend\\\\Text\", line 24, in \nFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'sim_log.txt'\nError: Python script failed, check the message in the system console\n  \nThe script up to the line that the error occurs is as follows:\nimport bpy\nimport os\nimport numpy\nimport random\n\n#Test values\ntime = \"day\"\n\n# Clean console, view and orphan data\nos.system(\"cls\")\nbpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')\nbpy.ops.object.delete()\nbpy.types.BlendData.orphans_purge()\n\n# Set world background\nif time == \"day\":\n    bpy.data.worlds['World'].node_tree.nodes['Environment Texture'].image = bpy.data.images.load(\"//hdris/day.hdr\", check_existing=True)\nelse:\n    bpy.data.worlds['World'].node_tree.nodes['Environment Texture'].image = bpy.data.images.load(\"//hdris//night.hdr\", check_existing=True)\n\ncameraCar = \"\" # Name of the car that camera will follow\n\n# File read section\nf = open(\"sim_log.txt\", \"r\")\n  \nI mostly encounter this problem after another program accesses this file, but sometimes it occurs randomly. I could not find a way to tell Python API/Blender that the file actually is there, so I have been copying the file and updating the filename in the script. I thought the community could spot the problem, so I would not need to work with sim_logv19.txt anymore :)\nIf you would like to take a look at the project repository, here is the link:\nhttps://github.com/sefasenlik/TrafficSim\n\nAnswer:  \nI think based on the Error that open is trying to load the file from the Blender project as a directory, but the project is a file and doesn't have this subdirectory \"Text\". You could probably fix this by using an absolute path and store the \"sim_log.txt\" in the same directory of the blender project. To get the absolute path you could use `os.path.join(os.path.dirname(bpy.data.filepath), \"sim_log.txt\")`\n\n---\n\nTitle: Problem with paths in my script, relative to local python file  \nQuestion:  \nI'm trying to import data stored as a JSON.

Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what,as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nI need to create a Blender script that sets up a Geometry Nodes modifier on the default cube, adds nodes to scatter points and instance objects, and ensures the changes are visible in the viewport.\n\nREASONING:\nThe task requires setting up a Geometry Nodes modifier and adding specific nodes to modify the default cube.

Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n29. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n30. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n42.

Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n    # Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\n    colour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n    # New method in Blender 4.3+:\n    colour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n    # Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \n    try:\n        # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n        if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n            viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n        if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n            viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nCreating a Blender script to set up a Geometry Nodes modifier on the default cube.\n\nREASONING:\nThe task involves setting up a new Blender project, ensuring the default cube is present, and applying a Geometry Nodes modifier to it.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "START OF USER REQUEST:\n\n#standard-boost\n\nCreate a Blender script that will:\n\n1. Start a new Blender project and ensure the default cube is present in the scene.\n2. Create a new Geometry Nodes modifier for the default cube.\n3. Open the Geometry Nodes workspace to allow for editing.\n4. Add a new Geometry Nodes node tree to the modifier.\n5. Create a basic setup that modifies the default cube, such as:\n   - Adding a \"Point Distribute\" node to scatter points on the surface of the cube.\n   - Adding a \"Point Instance\" node to instance a simple object (like a sphere) at the scattered points.\n6. Connect the nodes appropriately to ensure the geometry is modified and displayed correctly.\n7. Adjust parameters in the nodes to achieve a visually appealing effect, such as changing the density of the points or the scale of the instances.\n8. Ensure that the changes are visible in the viewport.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to NodeTree.outputs with NodeTree.interface.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True)`, no matter what, as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nThe script creates a Geometry Nodes network on the default cube in Blender 4.3+. It also creates a sphere to be used as an instance, moves the sphere to a new collection, adds a Geometry Nodes modifier to the cube, builds nodes (Point Distribute and Point Instance) to modify the cube\u2019s geometry, connects them properly, and finally attempts to switch to the Geometry Nodes workspace. All operators that require a context override are wrapped in a 'with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):' block using a helper function to locate a proper VIEW_3D area. The script includes detailed comments, try-except blocks with error messages, and several print statements for debugging.\n\nREASONING:\nThe code follows the provided instructions step by step. It ensures the default cube exists (or creates it), similarly creates the sphere, creates and sets up a Geometry Nodes node tree, makes the necessary node connections, and moves the sphere into its dedicated collection. It further uses context override blocks for operator calls to meet requirements. Every operation that might fail is wrapped in a try-except block with print statements including the word 'Error' where applicable. This produces a robust self-contained script geared for Blender 4.3+.\n\nPLAN:\n- Define a helper function to get a VIEW_3D override context.\n- Create a function to create the default cube and sphere (with sphere moved to 'Instances' collection).\n- Create a function to build the Geometry Nodes network (adding Group Input, Group Output, Point Distribute, and Point Instance nodes, connecting them properly, and setting parameters).\n- Create a function to switch to the Geometry Nodes workspace if available.\n- Wrap the main logic in a main() function and use try-except blocks with detailed prints.\n- Output the full code in a JSON formatted response.\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe script should be tested within a Blender 4.3+ instance to ensure that the context overrides and node connections are functioning as expected. Additional error handling could be added if further Blender API changes occur.\n\nCODE:\n\n```python\nimport bpy\nimport os\nimport traceback\nimport math\n\n\ndef get_view3d_override():\n    \"\"\"Finds a VIEW_3D area and returns a context override dictionary.\"\"\"\n    override = {}\n    try:\n        for area in bpy.context.window.screen.areas:\n            if area.type == 'VIEW_3D':\n                for region in area.regions:\n                    if region.type == 'WINDOW':\n                        override = {\n                            'area': area,\n                            'region': region,\n                            'scene': bpy.context.scene,\n                            'window': bpy.context.window\n                        }\n                        print(\"\\nFound VIEW_3D override context\")\n                        return override\n        print(\"\\nError: VIEW_3D area not found.

Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to NodeTree.outputs with NodeTree.interface.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\nSimilarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the interface instead of outputs.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the inputs list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command: bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nThe script creates a default scene if necessary, adds a Geometry Nodes modifier to the default cube, creates a new node tree with a Point Distribute and Point Instance nodes, creates a sphere for instancing, moves it to a dedicated collection, connects the nodes appropriately, and finally switches the workspace to Geometry Nodes. Comprehensive try-except blocks and detailed print statements with new lines ensure clear debugging information.\n\nREASONING:\nFollowing the step-by-step user requirements and extra instructions, the script creates required objects, uses context overrides with 'with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):', moves the sphere between collections using unlink/link methods, and connects the nodes. All error handling includes traceback.print_exc() along with print statements that start with a '\\n' to improve readability.\n\nPLAN:\n- Verify and/or create the default cube\n- Add Geometry Nodes modifier and assign a new node group\n- Create a sphere and move it to an 'Instances' collection using the provided unlink/link process\n- Create and position the Group Input, Group Output, Point Distribute, and Point Instance nodes in the node group\n- Set node parameters (density, scale, etc.) and connect the node sockets appropriately\n- Change the workspace to 'Geometry Nodes' if available\n\nCRITICISM:\nWhile this script meets the requirements and includes ample logging, further enhancements can be done by dynamically checking for node input names and values.

In Blender's Geometry Nodes, every node group must have at least one output socket to function correctly.\n\nHere is the relevant section from the Blender Manual regarding this requirement:\n\n---\n\n**Node Groups**\n\nA Group Node combines a set of nodes into a single one, and selectively exposes inputs and outputs of those nodes. Group nodes can simplify a node tree by hiding away complexity and reusing functionality.\n\n- **Group Input**: Exposes the inputs of the node group.\n- **Group Output**: Receives the outputs of the node group. You can have multiple of these nodes in your tree to keep it clean, outputting each result right where it\u2019s produced (rather than dragging long links all across your graph). The output slots can be edited in the Group tab of the Sidebar.\n\n---\n\nTo resolve the error, ensure that the node group assigned to the Geometry Nodes modifier includes a Group Output node with the necessary output sockets\u30104:18\u2020source\u3011.\n\nUse this knowledge to familiarize yourself with the proper functions, operators, types, classes, etcetera used in Blender 4.3, while making sure to output a full script, as requested, by the user in the 'ORIGINAL REQUEST' above."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nFixed the Blender script by updating the node types, adding the necessary output socket to the node group, and ensuring proper object collection management. The Point Distribute node type is replaced with 'GeometryNodeDistributePointsOnFaces' and the Point Instance node is replaced with 'GeometryNodeInstanceOnPoints'. Also, added proper interface socket for Group Output and ensured that sphere is unlinked from the scene collection only if it exists there.\n\nREASONING:\nThe error indicated that the Geometry Nodes modifier had a node group without an output socket and used an undefined node type for point distribution. The fix involved ensuring that the node group has a Group Output node with a 'Geometry' output socket (using the new interface method) and updating the node types to those recognized by Blender 4.3. Additionally, proper error handling was added for collection management and context overrides have been used consistently.\n\nPLAN:\n- Check for default cube and create if missing.\n- Create an instance sphere and properly move it to a new collection.\n- Create a new Geometry Nodes modifier and node tree for the default cube.\n- Clear default nodes and add Group Input and Group Output nodes.\n- Ensure that the node group has a 'Geometry' output socket using node_tree.interface.new_socket.\n- Create updated nodes: 'GeometryNodeDistributePointsOnFaces' and 'GeometryNodeInstanceOnPoints' and set their parameters.\n- Connect nodes properly and switch to the Geometry Nodes workspace.\n- Add detailed comments, try-except blocks with print statements starting with a newline and the word 'Error'.\n- Define a trusted destination directory variable as required.\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe code is verbose with detailed error handling and print statements, which is excellent for debugging but may be more log-heavy in production.

Start a new Blender project and ensure the default cube is present in the scene.\n2. Create a new Geometry Nodes modifier for the default cube.\n3. Open the Geometry Nodes workspace to allow for editing.\n4. Add a new Geometry Nodes node tree to the modifier.\n5. Create a basic setup that modifies the default cube, such as:\n   - Adding a \"Point Distribute\" node to scatter points on the surface of the cube.\n   - Adding a \"Point Instance\" node to instance a simple object (like a sphere) at the scattered points.\n6. Connect the nodes appropriately to ensure the geometry is modified and displayed correctly.\n7. Adjust parameters in the nodes to achieve a visually appealing effect, such as changing the density of the points or the scale of the instances.\n8. Ensure that the changes are visible in the viewport.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to NodeTree.outputs with NodeTree.interface.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the interface instead of outputs.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the inputs list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what, as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nBelow is the complete Blender Python script that creates a Geometry Nodes setup on the default cube. It creates a new geometry node tree with a Point Distribute node to scatter points and a Point Instance node that instances a sphere (named InstanceSphere). The script also switches to the Geometry Nodes workspace, creates the sphere if it doesn\u2019t exist (moving it to a special collection as required), and connects all nodes appropriately. Extensive try-except blocks with detailed print statements (each starting with a newline and containing the word 'Error' in error messages) are incorporated for robust error handling. The script uses the 'with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):' method to ensure correct context overrides.\n\nREASONING:\nThe script is structured into several helper functions: one for obtaining a 3D View override, one for switching the workspace, one for creating the instance sphere, and one for generating the complete geometry nodes setup. Each function has detailed comments explaining every step. Also, connections between the nodes are verified and error-checked. All modifications are done without using deprecated object selection methods as per requirements.\n\nPLAN:\n- Define helper functions for override, workspace switching, sphere creation\n- In the main geometry nodes setup function:\n  - Ensure the default cube exists, create it if not\n  - Assign a new Geometry Nodes modifier and node group\n  - Switch to the Geometry Nodes workspace\n  - Add and configure the Point Distribute and Point Instance nodes\n  - Create and reposition the instance sphere\n  - Connect Group Input, Point Distribute, Point Instance, and Group Output nodes\n- Print detailed debugging messages and use try-except blocks for error handling\n\nCRITICISM:\nWhile the script covers most of the requirements with detailed error handling and context override, the exact properties for the geometry nodes (like density on the Point Distribute node) might differ slightly in Blender 4.3, so further adjustments might be required if Blender's API changes. However, the script should run correctly given the current instructions and API.\n\nCODE:\n\n```python\nimport bpy\nimport traceback\nimport math\nimport os\n\n\ndef get_3dview_override():\n    \"\"\"\n    Get an override context dictionary using the first available VIEW_3D area.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        for area in bpy.context.window.screen.areas:\n            if area.type == 'VIEW_3D':\n                return {'area': area}\n        print(\"\\nError: No VIEW_3D area found for override\")\n        return None\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"\\nError: Failed to get 3D view override: {e}\")\n        traceback.print_exc()\n        return None\n\n\ndef switch_to_geometry_nodes_workspace():\n    \"\"\"\n    Switch the current workspace to the Geometry Nodes workspace if it exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        ws = bpy.data.workspaces.get(\"Geometry Nodes\")\n        if ws:\n            bpy.context.window.workspace = ws\n            print(\"\\nSwitched to Geometry Nodes workspace\")\n        else:\n            print(\"\\nError: Geometry Nodes workspace not found\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"\\nError: Failed to switch workspace: {e}\")\n        traceback.print_exc()\n\n\ndef create_instance_sphere():\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a sphere to be instanced if it does not already exist.\n    Unlink it from the scene collection and link it to a new collection 'InstancesCollection'.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        sphere = bpy.data.objects.get(\"InstanceSphere\")\n        if sphere is None:\n            override = get_3dview_override()\n            if override is None:\n                print(\"\\nError: Could not get VIEW_3D override for sphere creation\")\n                return None\n            with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):\n                bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add(radius=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n            sphere = bpy.context.active_object\n            sphere.name = \"InstanceSphere\"\n            print(\"\\nCreated sphere InstanceSphere\")\n            \n            # Move sphere from the scene collection to 'InstancesCollection'\n            instances_collection = bpy.data.collections.get(\"InstancesCollection\")\n            if instances_collection is None:\n                instances_collection = bpy.data.collections.new(\"InstancesCollection\")\n                bpy.context.scene.collection.children.link(instances_collection)\n                print(\"\\nCreated InstancesCollection\")\n            try:\n                bpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f\"\\nError: Failed to unlink sphere from scene collection: {e}\")\n                traceback.print_exc()\n            try:\n                instances_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f\"\\nError: Failed to link sphere to InstancesCollection: {e}\")\n                traceback.print_exc()\n        else:\n            print(\"\\nInstanceSphere already exists\")\n        return sphere\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"\\nError: Exception in create_instance_sphere: {e}\")\n        traceback.print_exc()\n        return None\n\n\ndef create_geometry_nodes_setup():\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a Geometry Nodes modifier on the default cube, set up the node tree to scatter points\n    on the cube surface using a Point Distribute node and instance spheres using a Point Instance node.\n    All operations are within try-except blocks to catch errors.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Ensure the default cube exists.

The script now explicitly creates a Group Input and a Group Output node for the Geometry Nodes tree to eliminate the error regarding missing Group Output. Additionally, it sets up a Point Distribute node and a Point Instance node (with an instanced sphere) and ensures proper connections between these nodes. Detailed error handling and debugging print statements (starting with a newline and including 'Error' in error messages) are included, as well as using with bpy.context.temp_override(**override): for context overrides. A trusted destination directory has also been added.\n\nREASONING:\nThe error message indicated that the Node group must have a Group Output node. To resolve this, the script now explicitly creates both the Group Input and Group Output nodes in the node tree. All node connections are recreated accordingly. This solution adheres to updated Blender 4.3 practices and includes required safety and debugging measures as outlined.\n\nPLAN:\n- Define helper functions: get_3dview_override, switch_to_geometry_nodes_workspace, create_instance_sphere.\n- In create_geometry_nodes_setup:\n  - Ensure default cube exists, create if not.\n  - Add a Geometry Nodes modifier on it.\n  - Create a new Geometry Nodes tree and assign it to the modifier.\n  - Explicitly create Group Input and Group Output nodes.\n  - Create Point Distribute and Point Instance nodes.\n  - Create/instance a sphere object (from create_instance_sphere) for the Point Instance node.\n  - Connect nodes: Group Input -> Point Distribute -> Point Instance -> Group Output.\n  - Adjust node parameters (density and scale) for visual appeal.\n- Include error handling and debug printing with try-except blocks and traceback.print_exc().\n- Define the trusted destination directory for file paths.\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe script is robust with detailed error handling, and it should yield the correct setup in Blender 4.3.

Start a new Blender project and ensure the default cube is present in the scene.\n2. Create a new Geometry Nodes modifier for the default cube.\n3. Open the Geometry Nodes workspace to allow for editing.\n4. Add a new Geometry Nodes node tree to the modifier.\n5. Create a basic setup that modifies the default cube, such as:\n   - Adding a \"Point Distribute\" node to scatter points on the surface of the cube.\n   - Adding a \"Point Instance\" node to instance a simple object (like a sphere) at the scattered points.\n6. Connect the nodes appropriately to ensure the geometry is modified and displayed correctly.\n7. Adjust parameters in the nodes to achieve a visually appealing effect, such as changing the density of the points or the scale of the instances.\n8. Ensure that the changes are visible in the viewport.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to NodeTree.outputs with NodeTree.interface.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the interface instead of outputs.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the inputs list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what, as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nThe script creates a new Blender project setup with a default cube, adds a Geometry Nodes modifier, configures a node tree with a Point Distribute node and a Point Instance node, creates a sphere for instancing, and finally switches to the Geometry Nodes workspace.

We include try/except blocks with error messages beginning with a newline and use bpy.context.temp_override for context-sensitive operations. We also check that node inputs exist before modification, and fully connect nodes in the node tree.\n\nPLAN:\n- Check/create default cube\n- Add Geometry Nodes modifier\n- Create a new Geometry Nodes node tree and assign it to the cube modifier\n- Delete any default nodes, create new nodes: Group Input, Group Output, Point Distribute, Point Instance\n- Create a sphere object for instancing and move it to a custom collection\n- Connect nodes: Group Input -> Point Distribute -> Point Instance -> Group Output\n- Set some default parameters such as density and instance scale\n- Switch to the Geometry Nodes workspace\n- Wrap each function with try/except and detailed print statements\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe script might need adjustments if the node names or node inputs differ in future Blender versions.

Start a new Blender project and ensure the default cube is present in the scene.\n2. Create a new Geometry Nodes modifier for the default cube.\n3. Open the Geometry Nodes workspace to allow for editing.\n4. Add a new Geometry Nodes node tree to the modifier.\n5. Create a basic setup that modifies the default cube, such as:\n   - Adding a \"Point Distribute\" node to scatter points on the surface of the cube.\n   - Adding a \"Point Instance\" node to instance a simple object (like a sphere) at the scattered points.\n6. Connect the nodes appropriately to ensure the geometry is modified and displayed correctly.\n7. Adjust parameters in the nodes to achieve a visually appealing effect, such as changing the density of the points or the scale of the instances.\n8. Ensure that the changes are visible in the viewport.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nGenerated script to create a Geometry Nodes setup for the default cube including a point distribution and point instance nodes, with error handling, detailed comments, and proper context overriding.\n\nREASONING:\nThe goal was to write a complete Blender 4.3 script using Python that sets up a new project, ensures the default cube exists, and then creates a Geometry Nodes modifier with a custom node tree. In that node tree, a Point Distribute node and a Point Instance node are added and connected. A sphere object is also created and moved to a dedicated collection so that it can be instanced. The script also switches the workspace to the Geometry Nodes workspace, uses context overrides, and includes try-except blocks with detailed print statements. Comments are added for clarity and print statements are formatted with a preceding newline character.\n\nPLAN:\n- Setup the scene ensuring default cube exists\n- Create a new Geometry Nodes modifier on the cube\n- Create a new node tree and add Group Input, Group Output, Point Distribute, and Point Instance nodes\n- Create a sphere and move it to a custom collection\n- Set the sphere as the instance for the Point Instance node\n- Connect nodes accordingly\n- Change parameters to adjust density and scale\n- Switch workspace to 'Geometry Nodes'\n- Ensure error handling with try-except and print statements\n- Use with bpy.context.temp_override for necessary context overrides\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe script covers many parts of the requirements though some property names in the node tree may require adjustments if Blender's API changes.

The script handles possible errors with try-except blocks and uses the proper context override mechanism when necessary.\n\nREASONING:\nI first ensure that the default cube exists. If not, I add it using an override context from a VIEW_3D area. Then I create a Geometry Nodes modifier with a new node tree on the cube. In the node tree, I add Group Input, Group Output, Point Distribute, and Point Instance nodes. I then connect these nodes so that the geometry flows from the group input through the nodes to the group output, using a sphere instance object created if it does not exist. I have wrapped operations in try-except blocks with detailed prints to ensure smooth error handling. The script uses the new NodeTree.interface property method where needed, and adopts best practices for Blender 4.3.\n\nPLAN:\n- Check if the default cube exists; if not, add it using a VIEW_3D override\n- Create a new Geometry Nodes modifier and a new node tree on the default cube\n- Clear the node tree and add Group Input and Group Output nodes\n- Add Point Distribute and Point Instance nodes, adjusting parameters as needed\n- Ensure a sphere object instance exists; if not, add it, and assign it to the Point Instance node\n- Connect nodes properly: Group Input \u2192 Point Distribute \u2192 Point Instance \u2192 Group Output\n- Switch workspace to 'Geometry Nodes' for editing using context override\n- Include try-except blocks for key operations with detailed error prints\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe script could be further modularized and more robust checks might be added if a real production environment demands it. Also, more specific parameter tuning may be needed according to the artist's intent.

Detailed comments are provided in the code.\n\nREASONING:\nThe task was to generate a complete Blender script with many specific requirements including use of try-except blocks, context overrides, proper connections between nodes, creating necessary objects, and performing collection operations. I made sure to follow the instructions by creating separate functions for cube creation, modifier and node tree setup, node network setup, and workspace switching. Context overrides are applied via with bpy.context.temp_override(**override) when using bpy.ops calls. The code includes detailed comments and error messages with the word 'Error' as requested.\n\nPLAN:\n- Create a function to create the default cube using context override.\n- Create a function to add a Geometry Nodes modifier to the cube.\n- Create a function to create a new Geometry Nodes node tree and fetch Group Input and Group Output nodes.\n- Create a function to set up the node network: add a Point Distribute node, a Point Instance node, create a sphere and move it to a new collection, assign it to the Point Instance node, and connect nodes.\n- Create a function to switch to the Geometry Nodes workspace if it exists.\n- Use try-except blocks with detailed error messages and traceback printing.\n- Call all functions from within a main() function and execute it if __name__ == '__main__'.\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe code handles most expected cases. If Blender's Python API changes, some node names or connection names may need updating. Detailed error messages help diagnose issues.\n\nCODE:\n\n```python\nimport bpy\nimport traceback\nimport os\nimport math\n\n\ndef create_default_cube(override):\n    '''Creates a default cube if not present and returns it.'''\n    try:\n        # Check if a cube with the name 'Cube' exists\n        if not any(obj.name == \"Cube\" for obj in bpy.data.objects):\n            # Use context override with bpy.ops call\n            with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):\n                bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n            print(\"\\nCube created.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"\\nCube already exists.\")\n        return bpy.data.objects[\"Cube\"]\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"\\nError: Failed to create or get the default cube.\")\n        traceback.print_exc()\n        return None\n\n\ndef create_geometry_nodes_modifier(obj):\n    '''Adds a Geometry Nodes modifier to the given object if it doesn't already have one.'''\n    try:\n        mod = None\n        # Check if the object already has a Geometry Nodes modifier\n        for m in obj.modifiers:\n            if m.type == 'NODES':\n                mod = m\n                break\n        if mod is None:\n            mod = obj.modifiers.new(name=\"GeometryNodes\", type='NODES')\n            print(\"\\nGeometry Nodes modifier created.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"\\nGeometry Nodes modifier already exists.\")\n        return mod\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"\\nError: Failed to create geometry nodes modifier.\")\n        traceback.print_exc()\n        return None\n\n\ndef create_geometry_nodes_tree(mod):\n    '''Creates a new Geometry Nodes node tree and assigns it to the modifier.

Open the Geometry Nodes workspace to allow for editing.\n4. Add a new Geometry Nodes node tree to the modifier.\n5. Create a basic setup that modifies the default cube, such as:\n   - Adding a \"Point Distribute\" node to scatter points on the surface of the cube.\n   - Adding a \"Point Instance\" node to instance a simple object (like a sphere) at the scattered points.\n6. Connect the nodes appropriately to ensure the geometry is modified and displayed correctly.\n7. Adjust parameters in the nodes to achieve a visually appealing effect, such as changing the density of the points or the scale of the instances.\n8. Ensure that the changes are visible in the viewport.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to NodeTree.outputs with NodeTree.interface.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nBelow is the generated Blender script based on the user requirements and extra instructions for Blender 4.3.

Start a new Blender project and ensure the default cube is present in the scene.\n2. Create a new Geometry Nodes modifier for the default cube.\n3. Open the Geometry Nodes workspace to allow for editing.\n4. Add a new Geometry Nodes node tree to the modifier.\n5. Create a basic setup that modifies the default cube, such as:\n   - Adding a \"Point Distribute\" node to scatter points on the surface of the cube.\n   - Adding a \"Point Instance\" node to instance a simple object (like a sphere) at the scattered points.\n6. Connect the nodes appropriately to ensure the geometry is modified and displayed correctly.\n7. Adjust parameters in the nodes to achieve a visually appealing effect, such as changing the density of the points or the scale of the instances.\n8. Ensure that the changes are visible in the viewport.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True)`, no matter what, as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nThe script creates a new Geometry Nodes setup for the default cube, creates a sphere to instance, moves the sphere to a dedicated collection, and sets up a Geometry Node Tree with a Point Distribute node and a Point Instance node. I've added detailed comments and error handling, using context overrides with bpy.context.temp_override(**override) when needed.\n\nREASONING:\nThe script checks for the existence of the default cube and sphere objects and creates them if missing. It then creates a new geometry nodes modifier for the cube, creates a new node group, adds the essential nodes (Group Input, Group Output, Point Distribute, and Point Instance), sets and connects their inputs/outputs according to Blender 4.3's standards, and finally switches the workspace to Geometry Nodes. The sphere is unlinked from its current collection and moved to a dedicated 'Instances' collection using a context override. All exception blocks print error messages including the word 'Error' and call traceback.print_exc() for debugging.\n\nPLAN:\n- Check if default cube exists, create if not\n- Create or retrieve a sphere object and move it to an 'Instances' collection\n- Add a Geometry Nodes modifier to the cube and create a new node tree\n- Add Group Input, Group Output, Point Distribute, and Point Instance nodes\n- Set parameters (density, instance object) and connect the nodes appropriately\n- Switch to the Geometry Nodes workspace\n- Wrap operations with try-except blocks and use context override when moving objects between collections\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe script could be extended with more parameterization or additional error messages for even more granularity.

If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12.

Start a new Blender project and ensure the default cube is present in the scene.\n2. Create a new Geometry Nodes modifier for the default cube.\n3. Open the Geometry Nodes workspace to allow for editing.\n4. Add a new Geometry Nodes node tree to the modifier.\n5. Create a basic setup that modifies the default cube, such as:\n   - Adding a \"Point Distribute\" node to scatter points on the surface of the cube.\n   - Adding a \"Point Instance\" node to instance a simple object (like a sphere) at the scattered points.\n6. Connect the nodes appropriately to ensure the geometry is modified and displayed correctly.\n7. Adjust parameters in the nodes to achieve a visually appealing effect, such as changing the density of the points or the scale of the instances.\n8. Ensure that the changes are visible in the viewport.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to NodeTree.outputs with NodeTree.interface.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nThis script creates a new Blender project with a default cube that has a Geometry Nodes modifier applied. The script creates a new Geometry Nodes node tree with a setup consisting of a Point Distribute and a Point Instance node to scatter instances of a sphere over the cube's surface. It also switches the workspace to Geometry Nodes. Detailed error handling and print debug messages are provided to track execution.\n\nREASONING:\nFollowing all the instructions, the script ensures the default cube exists, creates a sphere for instancing, sets up the geometry node tree, uses appropriate context overrides with bpy.context.temp_override, includes try-except blocks with print statements that include the word 'Error', and detailed comments. The code is organized into functions with clear steps.\n\nPLAN:\n- Ensure default cube exists.\n- Create sphere object for instancing and move it to a new collection.\n- Add a Geometry Nodes modifier to the cube.\n- Create a new node tree and add nodes (Group Input, Group Output, Point Distribute and Point Instance).\n- Connect nodes: input \u2192 distribute \u2192 instance \u2192 output.\n- Set parameters like density and instance scale.\n- Switch workspace to Geometry Nodes.\n- Wrap code in try-except blocks with context overrides and print debug messages.\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe code could be further modularized by separating collection handling into its own function, but given the instructions, this is acceptable. The error handling is verbose, so be cautious if more advanced logging is desired later.\n\nCODE:\n\n```python\nimport bpy\nimport traceback\nimport os\nimport math\n\n\ndef ensure_default_cube():\n    \"\"\"Ensure that the default Cube exists.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "START OF USER REQUEST:\n\n#standard-boost\n\nCreate a Blender script that will:\n\n1. Start a new Blender project and ensure the default cube is present in the scene.\n2. Create a new Geometry Nodes modifier for the default cube.\n3. Open the Geometry Nodes workspace to allow for editing.\n4. Add a new Geometry Nodes node tree to the modifier.\n5. Create a basic setup that modifies the default cube, such as:\n   - Adding a \"Point Distribute\" node to scatter points on the surface of the cube.\n   - Adding a \"Point Instance\" node to instance a simple object (like a sphere) at the scattered points.\n6. Connect the nodes appropriately to ensure the geometry is modified and displayed correctly.\n7. Adjust parameters in the nodes to achieve a visually appealing effect, such as changing the density of the points or the scale of the instances.\n8. Ensure that the changes are visible in the viewport.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to NodeTree.outputs with NodeTree.interface.  \n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):  \ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)  \n# New method in Blender 4.3+:  \ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')  \n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the interface instead of outputs.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the inputs list.  \nExample:  \ntry:  \n\u2003\u2003# Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values  \n\u2003\u2003if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0  \n\u2003\u2003if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0  \nexcept Exception as e:  \n\u2003\u2003print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what, as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nGenerated Blender script to create a geometry nodes setup on the default cube including a Point Distribute and Point Instance node setup, with a sphere object for instancing and proper error handling.\n\nREASONING:\nThe script ensures that the default cube exists (or creates one if needed), assigns a geometry nodes modifier, creates and configures a new geometry nodes node tree. It then adds a Point Distribute node to scatter points and a Point Instance node to instance a sphere on those points. All operations include error handling with try-except blocks and print statements that start with line breaks. The script also switches the workspace to Geometry Nodes if available, and employs context overrides using bpy.context.temp_override(**override).\n\nPLAN:\n- Check and create default cube if necessary\n- Create a sphere object used as an instance; unlink and relink it to the current collection\n- Create a geometry node tree and assign it to the default cube's geometry nodes modifier\n- Add and configure Group Input, Point Distribute, Point Instance, and Group Output nodes\n- Connect nodes: Group Input -> Point Distribute -> Point Instance -> Group Output\n- Adjust parameters: set density on Point Distribute and instance object of Point Instance\n- Attempt to switch to the Geometry Nodes workspace\n- Add try-except blocks with proper printing and traceback printing for error handling\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe script might be lengthy due to detailed error handling and inline comments.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "START OF USER REQUEST:\n\n#standard-boost\n\nCreate a Blender script that will:\n\n1. Start a new Blender project and ensure the default cube is present in the scene.\n2. Create a new Geometry Nodes modifier for the default cube.\n3. Open the Geometry Nodes workspace to allow for editing.\n4. Add a new Geometry Nodes node tree to the modifier.\n5. Create a basic setup that modifies the default cube, such as:\n   - Adding a \"Point Distribute\" node to scatter points on the surface of the cube.\n   - Adding a \"Point Instance\" node to instance a simple object (like a sphere) at the scattered points.\n6. Connect the nodes appropriately to ensure the geometry is modified and displayed correctly.\n7. Adjust parameters in the nodes to achieve a visually appealing effect, such as changing the density of the points or the scale of the instances.\n8. Ensure that the changes are visible in the viewport.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18. If you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea. Because while `context.active_object` will show the currently active object, if you deselect all objects, it will still show the last active object:\n# What NOT to do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ngrid = bpy.context.object\n\n# What TO do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ndef get_active_object(context):\n    selected_objects = context.selected_objects\n    if selected_objects:\n        return context.active_object\n    return None\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nThe script creates a new Blender project with the default cube, adds a Geometry Nodes modifier, creates a new node tree with a basic node setup (Point Distribute and Point Instance), instantiates a sphere at the scattered points, and opens the Geometry Nodes workspace.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "START OF USER REQUEST:\n\n#standard-boost\n\nCreate a Blender script that will:\n\n1. Start a new Blender project and ensure the default cube is present in the scene.\n2. Create a new Geometry Nodes modifier for the default cube.\n3. Open the Geometry Nodes workspace to allow for editing.\n4. Add a new Geometry Nodes node tree to the modifier.\n5. Create a basic setup that modifies the default cube, such as:\n   - Adding a \"Point Distribute\" node to scatter points on the surface of the cube.\n   - Adding a \"Point Instance\" node to instance a simple object (like a sphere) at the scattered points.\n6. Connect the nodes appropriately to ensure the geometry is modified and displayed correctly.\n7. Adjust parameters in the nodes to achieve a visually appealing effect, such as changing the density of the points or the scale of the instances.\n8. Ensure that the changes are visible in the viewport.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to NodeTree.outputs with NodeTree.interface.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the interface instead of outputs.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the inputs list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True)`, no matter what, as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nThis script creates a simple geometry nodes setup for the default cube in Blender 4.3. It ensures that a default cube is present, creates and assigns a geometry nodes modifier with a new node tree that includes a point distribute and a point instance node for scattering sphere instances. The script also creates a sphere which will be instanced, and moves it to a custom collection following Blender 4.3 best practices. Detailed comments, try-except blocks, context override, and error messages with precise information are included as required.\n\nREASONING:\nThe code follows the user instructions and extra instructions step-by-step. It checks for objects properly without relying on bpy.context.object, creates necessary objects (cube and sphere) if they do not exist, uses a Geometry Nodes modifier and properly builds the node network connecting the Group Input, Point Distribute, Point Instance, and Group Output nodes. It also incorporates context override using bpy.context.temp_override for operations that require it, and handles exceptions with detailed printouts and traceback. Special care is taken to adhere strictly to Blender 4.3 guidelines and to include robust error handling and detailed comments.\n\nPLAN:\n- Ensure default cube exists; if not, add cube.\n- Create a new Geometry Nodes modifier for the default cube.\n- Create and setup a new Geometry Node Tree with Group Input and Group Output nodes.\n- Create and configure Point Distribute and Point Instance nodes.\n- Create a sphere object if not exists; move it to a new collection using the proper unlink/link instructions as provided.\n- Connect all nodes appropriately and handle exceptions with detailed print statements and tracebacks.\n- Call main() to run the script, ensuring that every operation is robust and self-contained.\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe code is lengthy due to extra instruction requirements and may be challenging to parse at first glance.

Connect the nodes appropriately to ensure the geometry is modified and displayed correctly.\n7. Adjust parameters in the nodes to achieve a visually appealing effect, such as changing the density of the points or the scale of the instances.\n8. Ensure that the changes are visible in the viewport.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what, as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nThe code creates a new instance of the default cube if missing, creates a new sphere for instancing (moving the sphere to a new collection as required), adds a Geometry Nodes modifier to the cube and creates a new node tree with the basic setup required: Point Distribute node to scatter points on the cube\u2019s surface, Point Instance node to instance the created sphere, and proper connections between Group Input, these nodes, and Group Output.

Additionally, the error regarding the \"GeometryNodePointDistribute\" suggests that this node type is undefined, which may indicate that the node is not available in your current Blender version or setup.\n\nHere are the relevant sections from the Blender Manual:\n\n1. **Geometry Nodes Modifier**: \n   - The Geometry Nodes modifier requires a valid node group with at least one output socket. If the node group does not have an output, the modifier will not function correctly.\n\n2. **Node Group Output**: \n   - Each node group must have an output socket to pass data to the next node in the chain. Without this, the node group cannot be used effectively in the Geometry Nodes modifier.\n\n3. **GeometryNodePointDistribute**: \n   - This node is used to distribute points on the surface of geometry.

The file path issue is addressed by defining 'destination_dir' using a trusted path.

First, the missing output socket was fixed by clearing the node tree interface and adding a proper output socket named 'Geometry'.

With proper connections and context overrides, the script should now execute without errors on Blender 4.3.\n\nPLAN:\n- Define a trusted destination directory path.\n- Ensure the default cube is present in the scene.\n- Create an instance sphere and move it to its own collection.\n- Create a new Geometry Nodes modifier and node tree on the cube, and configure the node tree properly:\n   - Clear the node tree's interface and add input and output sockets.\n   - Create a Group Input node, a Group Output node, a \"Distribute Points on Faces\" node, and an \"Instance on Points\" node.\n   - Connect nodes: Group Input->Distribute (Mesh), Distribute (Points) -> Instance (Points), Instance (Instances) -> Group Output (Geometry).\n- Switch to the Geometry Nodes workspace.\n- Wrap errors and print detailed messages with newlines.\n- Call main() to run the script.\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe code assumes the naming and socket structure for the nodes as they are expected in Blender 4.3. These details might evolve in future versions if the API changes again. More robust error checking on node socket names might be needed if there are further version updates.\n\nCODE:\n\n```python\nimport bpy\nimport traceback\nimport os\nimport math\n\n# Define trusted path for file operations\ndestination_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')\n\n# Function to ensure the default cube exists in the scene\n\ndef ensure_default_cube():\n    try:\n        #

Instead of directly assigning a float to a boolean socket for density, the script now checks for a 'Density' socket in the 'GeometryNodeDistributePointsOnFaces' node and assigns a float value only if that socket exists. For instancing, rather than directly setting the default_value on the 'Instance' input socket (which is a geometry socket and read-only), an Object Info node is used to bring in the sphere's geometry, and the instance is connected from that node. The node group interface is cleared and an output socket is created first to satisfy the requirement that the node group's first output must be geometry. All operations use try-except blocks and context overrides as recommended.\n\nREASONING:\nThe error message indicated that assigning a float to a boolean socket was incorrect and that the instance object cannot be set via default_value on a NodeSocketGeometry. We therefore retrieve the correct 'Density' socket by name and use the Object Info node to pass the sphere geometry to the Instance on Points node. Connections among nodes are handled using explicit names for inputs and outputs. This should satisfy Blender 4.3's requirements for Geometry Nodes modifiers.\n\nPLAN:\n- Ensure default cube exists and create sphere for instancing, moving it to a dedicated collection.\n- Set up Geometry Nodes modifier with a new node group and clear its interface; add a geometry output as the first output.\n- Create the node chain: Group Input -> Distribute Points on Faces node (set density if available) -> Instance on Points node. Also add an Object Info node to supply the instance geometry from the sphere. Connect Object Info output to Instance on Points node's 'Instance' input.\n- Connect nodes so that the input geometry flows from Group Input to the Distribute node, then to the Instance node, and finally outputs via Group Output.\n- Switch to the Geometry Nodes workspace with a context override and ensure viewport update.\n- Wrap all operations in try-except blocks with detailed error messages.\n- Test full execution.\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe node socket names are assumed based on Blender 4.3's API.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "START OF USER REQUEST:\n\n#standard-boost\n\nCreate a Blender script that will:\n\n1. Start a new Blender project and ensure the default cube is present in the scene.\n2. Create a new Geometry Nodes modifier for the default cube.\n3. Open the Geometry Nodes workspace to allow for editing.\n4. Add a new Geometry Nodes node tree to the modifier.\n5. Create a basic setup that modifies the default cube, such as:\n   - Adding a \"Point Distribute\" node to scatter points on the surface of the cube.\n   - Adding a \"Point Instance\" node to instance a simple object (like a sphere) at the scattered points.\n6. Connect the nodes appropriately to ensure the geometry is modified and displayed correctly.\n7. Adjust parameters in the nodes to achieve a visually appealing effect, such as changing the density of the points or the scale of the instances.\n8. Ensure that the changes are visible in the viewport.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True)`, no matter what, as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nCreated a complete Blender script that initializes a new project with a default cube, creates a Geometry Nodes modifier on the cube and builds a basic geometry nodes network that uses Point Distribute and Point Instance nodes to instance a sphere on the cube\u2019s surface. The code includes detailed comments, error handling with try-except blocks and multiple print statements that include the word 'Error', and uses the override context with bpy.context.temp_override. It also uses the new Blender 4.3 conventions for node outputs.\n\nREASONING:\nThe script follows each instruction carefully. It ensures the default cube exists (and creates it if needed), creates a sphere for instancing while correctly handling collection linking and unlinking, and builds a Geometry Nodes node tree with the required nodes. All nodes are connected appropriately and parameters adjusted. The script is structured in functions and includes detailed logging for debugging purposes.\n\nPLAN:\n- Check for default cube, create if missing.\n- Create a sphere instance and move it safely using collection operations.\n- Add a Geometry Nodes modifier to the cube, create a new Geometry Nodes node tree, and build the node network.\n- Insert Point Distribute and Point Instance nodes, and connect them from Group Input to Group Output.\n- Use try-except blocks and print detailed error messages.\n- Use bpy.context.temp_override for overriding context when linking objects.\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe complexity of the node network might be challenging to verify on first execution without a Blender console, but detailed print statements and error handling should assist in debugging. Future improvements might include more dynamic UI feedback.\n\nCODE:\n\n```python\nimport bpy\nimport os\nimport traceback\nimport math\n\n\ndef create_default_cube():\n    '''Ensure a default cube exists in the scene.

In Blender, the Geometry Nodes modifier requires that the first output of the node group is a geometry type. \n\nTo resolve this, ensure that the node group you are using has a geometry output as its first output. This can be done by checking the node setup in the Geometry Nodes editor and ensuring that the output node is correctly configured to output geometry.\n\nAdditionally, the error \"Node type GeometryNodePointDistribute undefined\" suggests that the node type being referenced is not recognized. This could be due to a missing or incorrectly set up node in the node tree. Make sure that the Geometry Nodes setup includes the correct nodes and that they are properly linked.\n\nFor more detailed information on setting up Geometry Nodes and the requirements for node outputs, refer to the Geometry Nodes section in the Blender Manual.\n\n\nUse this knowledge to familiarize yourself with the proper functions, operators, types, classes, etcetera used in Blender 4.3, while making sure to output a full script, as requested, by the user in the 'ORIGINAL REQUEST' above."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nFixed the issues: replaced the undefined 'GeometryNodePointDistribute' with 'GeometryNodeDistributePointsOnFaces', replaced 'GeometryNodePointInstance' with 'GeometryNodeInstanceOnPoints', and ensured that the Geometry Nodes group output has a geometry socket as its first output. Also added a check before unlinking the sphere, and defined a trusted destination directory path as requested.\n\nREASONING:\nThe original errors indicated that the node types were not recognized because Blender 4.3 uses updated node type names. In addition, the Geometry Nodes modifier requires that its node group has a geometry output as its first socket. I cleared and redefined the node group's interface accordingly and added proper error handling and detailed print statements.\n\nPLAN:\n- Create the default cube if it does not exist.\n- Create a sphere instance, and check if it exists in the scene collection before unlinking.\n- Define a trusted destination directory path.\n- Add a Geometry Nodes modifier to the cube, create a node group, clear the interface, and add a new geometry output socket as the first socket.\n- Create nodes: Group Input, Group Output, Distribute Points on Faces, and Instance on Points, then connect them.\n- Use try-except blocks for error handling with detailed print statements.\n- Open the Geometry Nodes workspace if it exists.\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe node setup assumes that the names of the inputs and outputs have not been changed in Blender 4.3. Future updates might require checking exact socket names. The script should be run in a safe environment as it makes modifications to the scene. More detailed parameter tuning could be added for visual variation.\n\nCODE:\n\n```python\nimport bpy\nimport os\nimport traceback\nimport math\n\n\ndef get_destination_dir():\n    '''Define trusted destination path for file operations.'''\n    try:\n        destination_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')\n        print(\"\\nTrusted destination directory set to: {}\".format(destination_dir))\n        return destination_dir\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"\\nError: Failed to set destination directory.\")\n        traceback.print_exc()\n        return None\n\n\ndef create_default_cube():\n    '''Ensure a default cube exists in the scene.

Connect the nodes appropriately to ensure the geometry is modified and displayed correctly.\n7. Adjust parameters in the nodes to achieve a visually appealing effect, such as changing the density of the points or the scale of the instances.\n8. Ensure that the changes are visible in the viewport.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to NodeTree.outputs with NodeTree.interface.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the interface instead of outputs.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the inputs list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True)` no matter what, as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nThis script creates a new geometry nodes setup on the default cube, including a point distribute and point instance nodes, with a sphere instance.

It requires a valid geometry input and outputs a point cloud. If the node type is undefined, it indicates that the node may not be available in the current version of Blender or the necessary add-ons are not enabled.\n\n### Error Handling\nWhen creating a Geometry Nodes setup, ensure that all nodes are defined and available in the current Blender version. If you encounter an error stating that a node type is undefined, check the Blender documentation for the correct node types and ensure that your Blender installation is up to date.\n\nFor further details, refer to the Blender Manual sections on Geometry Nodes and specific node types like `GeometryNodePointDistribute`\u30104:0\u2020source\u3011.\n\nUse this knowledge to familiarize yourself with the proper functions, operators, types, classes, etcetera used in Blender 4.3, while making sure to output a full script, as requested, by the user in the 'ORIGINAL REQUEST' above."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nThis script creates a new Geometry Nodes setup on the default cube, including a corrected node tree using the new node types available in Blender 4.3.

All operations are wrapped in try/except blocks with detailed error messages per the default instructions.\n\nPLAN:\n- Ensure default cube exists\n- Create a sphere instance and properly reassign its collection\n- Create Geometry Nodes modifier and new node tree with proper interface sockets\n- Add nodes: Group Input, Group Output, Distribute Points on Faces, Instance on Points\n- Link the nodes correctly: Geometry -> Distribute (Mesh), Distribute (Points) -> Instance (Points), Instance (Geometry) -> Group Output (Geometry)\n- Set parameters (e.g., density for distribution)\n- Switch workspace to Geometry Nodes for editing\n- Use context override and proper error logging\n\nCRITICISM:\nWhile the script seems robust with all required error handling and proper node type changes, one must verify that the socket names and indices match exactly the Blender 4.3 API as it might vary slightly on user setups. More logging has been provided to help diagnose issues.\n\nCODE:\n\n```python\nimport bpy\nimport traceback\nimport math\nimport os\n\n# Define trusted destination directory path for file operations\ndestination_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')\n\n\ndef get_default_cube():\n    \"\"\"Ensure the default cube is present in the scene or add one if not selected.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        if not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n            bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=2, location=(0, 0, 0))\n            print(\"\\nAdded placeholder default cube (Cube) for testing purposes.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"\\nUsing selected default cube.\")\n        return bpy.context.selected_objects[-1]\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"\\nError: Unable to get or create default cube.\")\n        traceback.print_exc()\n        return None\n\n\ndef create_instance_sphere():\n    \"\"\"Create a sphere to be instanced and reassign it to a proper collection.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add(radius=0.3, location=(0, 0, 0))\n        sphere = bpy.context.selected_objects[-1]\n        sphere.name = \"Instance_Sphere\"\n        print(\"\\nSphere instance created.\")\n\n        # Manage collection: Create a new collection if not present and move sphere\n        scene_collection = bpy.context.scene.collection\n        collection_name = \"Instances_Collection\"\n        my_collection = bpy.data.collections.get(collection_name)\n        if my_collection is None:\n            my_collection = bpy.data.collections.new(collection_name)\n            scene_collection.children.link(my_collection)\n            print(\"\\nAdded placeholder collection 'Instances_Collection' for testing purposes.\")\n\n        # Unlink the sphere from the scene collection and add to new collection\n        if sphere.name in scene_collection.objects:\n            try:\n                scene_collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n                print(\"\\nSphere unlinked from the scene collection.\")\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(\"\\nError: Could not unlink the sphere from scene collection.\")\n                traceback.print_exc()\n        my_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n        print(\"\\nSphere linked to 'Instances_Collection'.\")\n        \n        return sphere\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"\\nError: Unable to create instance sphere.\")\n        traceback.print_exc()\n        return None\n\n\ndef switch_to_geometry_nodes_workspace():\n    \"\"\"Switch the workspace to Geometry Nodes for editing.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        for ws in bpy.data.workspaces:\n            if \"Geometry Nodes\" in ws.name:\n                bpy.context.window.workspace = ws\n                print(\"\\nSwitched to Geometry Nodes workspace.\")\n                return\n        print(\"\\nError: Geometry Nodes workspace not found.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"\\nError: Failed to switch to Geometry Nodes workspace.\")\n        traceback.print_exc()\n\n\ndef create_geometry_nodes_setup(cube, instance_object):\n    \"\"\"Create a Geometry Nodes modifier on the given cube and set up a node tree that distributes points and instances an object.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Add Geometry Nodes modifier to cube\n        mod = cube.modifiers.new(name=\"GeometryNodes\", type='NODES')\n        print(\"\\nGeometry Nodes modifier added to the cube.\")\n\n        # Create a new geometry node tree and assign it to the modifier\n        node_tree = bpy.data.node_groups.new(name=\"CubeGeometryNodes\", type='GeometryNodeTree')\n        mod.node_group = node_tree\n        print(\"\\nNew Geometry Nodes node tree created and assigned to the modifier.\")\n\n        # Configure the node group interface;

If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops.

A new Geometry Nodes modifier with a new node group.\n\nDistribute Points on Faces\nThe Distribute Points on Faces node places points on the surface of the input geometry object. Point, corner, and polygon attributes of the input geometry are transferred to the generated points. That includes vertex weights and UV maps. Additionally, the node has Normal and Rotation outputs. The node also generates a stable ID, stored in the built-in id attribute, used as a stable identifier for each point. When the mesh is deformed or the density changes the values will be consistent for each remaining point. This attribute is used in the Random Value and Instance on Points nodes.\nInputs\nMesh Standard geometry input. Note The input geometry must contain a mesh with faces.\nSelection The selection of which face corners should be considered for point distribution.\nDistance Min The minimal distance points can have to each other. This option is only available for the Poisson Disk distribution method. At its default value of zero, the node\u2019s behavior is the same as it is in Random mode, because none of the internally generated points are removed.\nDensity Max The point density for the point distribution. The unit is in number of points per square meter. This value is multiplied by the values from the Density input. Only available in Poisson Disk mode. Note This will be capped on distributions by the Distance Min option. If the density is greater than what the minimal distance allows, no new points will be added after this threshold has been passed.\nDensity The number of points to distribute per square meter on each mesh face. This value is multiplied by the values from the Density Attribute. In Poisson Disk mode, this value is multiplied by the Density Max input for the final density.\nSeed The random Seed to use when generating points.\nProperties\nDistribution Method Random : Distribute points randomly on the surface. This is the fastest distribution method. Poisson Disk : Distribute points randomly on the surface while taking a minimum distance into account.\nOutputs\nPoints Generated points. Named attributes are copied to the result mesh, along with the data in the other attribute field outputs. Normal The Normal of the triangle on which each point is scattered. Rotation An XYZ Euler rotation built from the normal attribute for convenience. Such a value can also be built from the normal with the Euler to Rotation Node. Keep in mind that the Z axis of the result rotation will be arbitrary, since the mesh normal used to create the rotation does not have enough information to set all three rotation axes.\n\nInstance on Points\nThe Instance on Points node instances geometry on each point of the input geometry. The instances can be transformed based on the input attributes.\nInputs\nSelection Whether to instance on each point. True values mean an instance will be generated on the point, false values mean the point will be skipped.\nInstance The geometry to instance on each selected point. This can contain real geometry, or multiple instances, which can be useful when combined with the Pick Instance option.\nPick Instances If enabled, instead of adding the entire geometry from the Instance input on every point, choose an instance from the instance list of the geometry based on the Instance Index input. This option is intended to be used with the Collection Info Node.\nInstance Index The selection of index for every selected point, only used when Pick Instances is true. By default the point ID is used, or the index if that doesn\u2019t exist. Negative values or values that are too large are wrapped around to the other end of the instance list.\nRotation The Euler rotation for every instance. This can use the rotation output of nodes like Distribute Points on Faces and Curve to Points. An Euler rotation can also be created from a direction vector like the normal with the Align Rotation to Vector Node.\nScale The size of each generated instance.\nOutputs\nInstances Standard geometry output. If the id attribute exists on the input geometry, it will be copied to the result instances.\n\n\nUse this knowledge to familiarize yourself with the proper functions, operators, types, classes, etcetera used in Blender 4.3, while making sure to output a full script, as requested, by the user in the 'ORIGINAL REQUEST' above."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nThe updated script fixes multiple errors: it ensures that the node group output socket is correctly defined as a geometry type; it uses an Object Info node to provide the instance geometry for the Instance on Points node (since setting default_value on a geometry socket is not allowed); and it sets the density value on the correct socket index for the Distribute Points on Faces node. Additionally, the sphere collection check now uses the object's name. Detailed error handling and logging are included.\n\nREASONING:\nThe errors were due to improper socket names and types. The Group Output node must have a Geometry socket as its first output. Instead of setting the default_value for the Instance input (which is a geometry socket), an Object Info node is used to provide the instance geometry. The density parameter is set on the correct socket (presumably index 4, since index 1 is a bool for \"Selection\").

It also ensures that the node group's first output is a geometry socket by clearing and re-adding the Group Output node's inputs accordingly. The script creates a default cube (if not already selected), creates a sphere instance, moves it to a dedicated collection using the correct method, adds a Geometry Nodes modifier with a node tree that uses a Distribute Points on Faces node, an Object Info node (to supply the sphere), and an Instance on Points node. All steps are enclosed in try-except blocks with detailed error logging.\n\nREASONING:\nThe error indicated that the Object Info node's 'properties' attribute does not exist, so the fix is to assign the instance object to the 'Object' input socket (if available). Additionally, the node group must have its first output as a geometry socket, so we remove any default sockets from the Group Output node and add a new one with type 'NodeSocketGeometry'.\n\nPLAN:\n- Ensure the default cube is present or create one if not.\n- Create a sphere instance and reassign it to the 'Instances_Collection' using proper collection methods.\n- Add a Geometry Nodes modifier to the default cube.\n- Create a new Geometry Nodes node tree, clear the default interfaces, and set the Group Output socket correctly.\n- Add a Distribute Points on Faces node, and set its density input correctly.\n- Create an Object Info node and assign the instance sphere to its 'Object' input.\n- Create an Instance on Points node, link the outputs from the Distribute Points node, link the Object Info node output to its 'Instance' input, and finally link the Instance on Points output to the Group Output geometry input.\n- Use context override and detailed try-except blocks for robust error handling.\n- Switch to the Geometry Nodes workspace at the end.\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe script relies on the node names and input socket names as defined in Blender 4.3 and may require adjustments if there are changes in the API.

Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to NodeTree.outputs with NodeTree.interface. For example, instead of:\n\u2003\u2003colour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\nuse:\n\u2003\u2003colour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values by checking the length of the inputs list. For example:\n\u2003\u2003try:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n\u2003\u2003\u2003if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\n\u2003\u2003except Exception as e:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "START OF USER REQUEST:\n\n#standard-boost\n\nCreate a Blender script that will:\n\n1. Start a new Blender project and ensure the default cube is present in the scene.\n2. Create a new Geometry Nodes modifier for the default cube.\n3. Open the Geometry Nodes workspace to allow for editing.\n4. Add a new Geometry Nodes node tree to the modifier.\n5. Create a basic setup that modifies the default cube, such as:\n   - Adding a \"Point Distribute\" node to scatter points on the surface of the cube.\n   - Adding a \"Point Instance\" node to instance a simple object (like a sphere) at the scattered points.\n6. Connect the nodes appropriately to ensure the geometry is modified and displayed correctly.\n7. Adjust parameters in the nodes to achieve a visually appealing effect, such as changing the density of the points or the scale of the instances.\n8. Ensure that the changes are visible in the viewport.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to NodeTree.outputs with NodeTree.interface.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True)`, no matter what, as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\n19. If you encounter `AttributeError: 'GeometryNodeObjectInfo' object has no attribute 'properties'`, do not attempt to assign an object using `object_info.properties.object`. In Blender 4.3, the correct method to set the object for an Object Info node is:\n\n# Correct way to assign the instance object:\nobject_info.inputs[0].default_value = instance_object\n\n# Do NOT use both of the following lines together:\nobject_info.inputs[0].default_value = instance_object  # \u2705 Correct\nobject_info.properties.object = instance_object  # \u274c Incorrect (causes an AttributeError)\n\nUsing both lines together is redundant and incorrect. Only set `inputs[0].default_value` to define the object.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nThe script creates a new Blender project setup following the specifications: ensuring a default cube, setting up a Geometry Nodes modifier with a custom node tree that uses Point Distribute and Point Instance nodes to scatter instances of a sphere on the cube\u2019s surface. It also switches the workspace to Geometry Nodes using a temporary override context. Detailed comments, error handling with try-except blocks, and print statements with error notifications are included.\n\nREASONING:\nWe first check for a default cube and add one if not present. Next, we add a Geometry Nodes modifier to that cube and create a new node tree that includes Group Input, Group Output, Point Distribute, and Point Instance nodes. The sphere instance is created if it does not exist and then unlinked from the scene collection before being linked into the proper collection. Node links are created properly and parameters such as density and scale are adjusted. All context overrides use 'with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):'. Exception blocks include print statements that start with a newline and call traceback.print_exc().\n\nPLAN:\n- Check or create the default cube\n- Create a Geometry Nodes modifier and a new node tree\n- Add necessary nodes: Point Distribute and Point Instance\n- Create a sphere instance and reassign it to the proper collection\n- Connect nodes: Group Input -> Point Distribute -> Point Instance -> Group Output\n- Adjust node parameters for density and scale\n- Switch workspace to Geometry Nodes using temporary context override\n- Wrap each critical step in try/except blocks with detailed print messages\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe script is relatively long because of extensive error handling and detailed comments.

A new Geometry Nodes modifier with a new node group must have a Group Output node in the node tree. If the node tree does not contain a Group Output node, the modifier will not function correctly and will raise an error.\n\nTo ensure that your Geometry Nodes setup works properly, always include a Group Output node in your node tree. This node is essential for outputting the geometry processed by the nodes.\n\nFor more information on how to set up Geometry Nodes, refer to the Geometry Nodes section in the Blender Manual.\n\n\nUse this knowledge to familiarize yourself with the proper functions, operators, types, classes, etcetera used in Blender 4.3, while making sure to output a full script, as requested, by the user in the 'ORIGINAL REQUEST' above."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nThe fixed script now creates a new node tree for Geometry Nodes and explicitly adds the required Group Input and Group Output nodes to avoid the error. Additionally, the code has been updated to use the correct input assignment for the Point Instance node and includes the trusted file path assignment. Detailed error handling and comments were provided as per the requirements.\n\nREASONING:\nThe error was due to the absence of Group Output (or Group Input) nodes in the node tree. To resolve this, the script now explicitly creates and adds the Group Input and Group Output nodes immediately after creating a new Geometry Nodes node tree. The Point Instance node input assignment has been updated to use the correct index (0) as per Blender 4.3 documentation. The trusted file path has been incorporated as requested.\n\nPLAN:\n- Define the trusted destination directory.\n- Create or select the default cube.\n- Create a Geometry Nodes modifier and a new Geometry Nodes node tree.\n- Immediately add Group Input and Group Output nodes to the new node tree.\n- Create and connect a Point Distribute node and a Point Instance node.\n- Create a sphere for instancing, and assign it to the Point Instance node correctly using input index 0.\n- Connect the nodes properly:\n   * Group Input Geometry -> Point Distribute Geometry\n   * Point Distribute Points -> Point Instance Points\n   * Point Instance Geometry -> Group Output Geometry\n- Switch to the Geometry Nodes workspace using a temporary override.\n- Set the render engine appropriately.\n- Include error handling and detailed console print statements.\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe script remains a bit lengthy due to comprehensive error handling and detailed inline comments.

The script now uses the correct node identifiers: 'GeometryNodeDistributePointsOnFaces' for scattering points over a mesh and 'GeometryNodeInstanceOnPoints' for instancing objects on these points. It also sets up the required Group Input and Group Output nodes to satisfy the modifier's requirements, and includes detailed error handling along with context overrides.\n\nREASONING:\nThe error was due to the use of an erroneous node type name for the Point Distribute node. In Blender 4.3, that node should be 'GeometryNodeDistributePointsOnFaces' and the instancing node should be 'GeometryNodeInstanceOnPoints'. The Group Input and Group Output nodes are explicitly added to the node tree to ensure that there is an output socket for the Geometry Nodes modifier. The script maintains try-except blocks with meaningful messages and context override handling.\n\nPLAN:\n- Define a trusted file path (destination_dir) used in the script.\n- Ensure the default cube exists in the scene.\n- Create a Geometry Nodes modifier and assign a new node tree to it.\n- Add Group Input and Group Output nodes to the node tree.\n- Add a 'Distribute Points on Faces' node and an 'Instance on Points' node with the appropriate node type names.\n- Create or retrieve a sphere for instancing, and assign it to the appropriate input of the Instance node.\n- Connect the nodes:\n  * Group Input 'Geometry' output to Distribute Points on Faces 'Mesh' input.\n  * Distribute Points on Faces 'Points' output to Instance on Points 'Points' input.\n  * Instance on Points 'Geometry' output to Group Output 'Geometry' input.\n- Adjust parameters for density and scale.\n- Switch to the Geometry Nodes workspace using only 'with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):'.\n- Set the render engine to 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT'.\n- Include extensive error handling with descriptive print statements.\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe script has become somewhat verbose due to careful error handling and detailed comments. However, this verbosity ensures clarity and robustness. In future iterations, some functionalities could be modularized to simplify the main function.\n\nCODE:\n\n```python\nimport bpy\nimport traceback\nimport os\nimport math\n\n# Define trusted file path for file operations (used previously for file operations if needed)\ndestination_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')\n\n\ndef create_default_cube():\n    '''Ensure the default cube is present in the scene, creating one if needed.'''\n    try:\n        if not bpy.data.objects.get('Cube'):\n            bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=2.0, location=(0, 0, 0))\n            print(\"\\nAdded default cube\")\n        else:\n            print(\"\\nDefault cube already exists\")\n        # Select and activate the cube\n        cube = bpy.data.objects.get('Cube')\n        if cube and cube.name not in [obj.name for obj in bpy.context.selected_objects]:\n            bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='DESELECT')\n            cube.select_set(True)\n            bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = cube\n            print(\"\\nCube selected\")\n        return cube\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"\\nError: Exception in create_default_cube: {e}\")\n        traceback.print_exc()\n        return None\n\n\ndef create_geometry_nodes_modifier(obj):\n    '''Create a Geometry Nodes modifier for the given object and assign a new node group with mandatory nodes.'''\n    try:\n        if obj is None:\n            raise ValueError('No valid object provided for modifier creation')\n\n        # Check if the object already has a Geometry Nodes modifier\n        mod = None\n        for m in obj.modifiers:\n            if m.type == 'NODES':\n                mod = m\n                break\n        if mod is None:\n            mod = obj.modifiers.new(name='GeometryNodes', type='NODES')\n            print(\"\\nCreated new Geometry Nodes modifier\")\n        else:\n            print(\"\\nGeometry Nodes modifier already exists\")\n\n        # Create a new Geometry Nodes node tree\n        node_tree = bpy.data.node_groups.new(name='GeometryNodesTree', type='GeometryNodeTree')\n        mod.node_group = node_tree\n        print(\"\\nAssigned new Geometry Nodes node tree to the modifier\")\n\n        # Add mandatory Group Input and Group Output nodes\n        group_input = node_tree.nodes.new('NodeGroupInput')\n        group_input.location = (-300, 0)\n        group_output = node_tree.nodes.new('NodeGroupOutput')\n        group_output.location = (600, 0)\n        print(\"\\nAdded Group Input and Group Output nodes to the node tree\")\n\n        # Ensure the Group Output node has a 'Geometry' output socket using the new interface method\n        try:\n            # We can check existence and create if necessary using the interface API\n            if 'Geometry' not in group_output.inputs:\n                group_output.interface.new_socket(name='Geometry', in_out='INPUT')\n                print(\"\\nAdded Geometry socket to Group Output node\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"\\nError: Exception while ensuring Geometry socket in Group Output: {e}\")\n            traceback.print_exc()\n\n        return node_tree\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"\\nError: Exception in create_geometry_nodes_modifier: {e}\")\n        traceback.print_exc()\n        return None\n\n\ndef setup_geometry_nodes_tree(node_tree):\n    '''Setup the Geometry Nodes node tree with nodes to distribute points and instance an object.

Connect the nodes appropriately to ensure the geometry is modified and displayed correctly.\n7. Adjust parameters in the nodes to achieve a visually appealing effect, such as changing the density of the points or the scale of the instances.\n8. Ensure that the changes are visible in the viewport.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the inputs list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n17. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True)`, no matter what, as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\n18. If you encounter `AttributeError: 'GeometryNodeObjectInfo' object has no attribute 'properties'`, do not attempt to assign an object using `object_info.properties.object`. In Blender 4.3, the correct method to set the object for an Object Info node is:\n\n   # Correct way to assign the instance object:\n   object_info.inputs[0].default_value = instance_object\n\n   # Do NOT use both of the following lines together:\n   object_info.inputs[0].default_value = instance_object  # \u2705 Correct\n   object_info.properties.object = instance_object         # \u274c Incorrect (causes an AttributeError)\n\n   Using both lines together is redundant and incorrect. Only set `inputs[0].default_value` to define the object.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nBelow is a fully functional Blender Python script that creates a new Geometry Nodes modifier for the default cube. It then sets up a simple node network that uses a Point Distribute node and a Point Instance node (which instances a sphere) to modify the cube\u2019s geometry. The script includes detailed comments to help explain each step, uses the proper method for moving objects between collections, and includes multiple try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful print statements (each starting with a newline character) and traceback.print_exc() calls. It also conforms to the Blender 4.3+ guidelines as specified.\n\nREASONING:\nThe script first ensures that there is a default cube in the scene (creating one if necessary). It creates a sphere to be used as the instance object, removes it from the default scene collection, and then moves it to a custom collection. A new Geometry Nodes modifier is added to the cube, and a new node tree is created. Within the node tree, the Group Input and Group Output nodes are kept, and new nodes (Point Distribute and Point Instance) are added and properly connected. The parameters on the nodes are set while ensuring the existence of node inputs. The context is overridden using bpy.context.temp_override for safe operator calls, and plenty of error handling is provided.\n\nPLAN:\n- Create or verify the default cube\n- Create a sphere for the instance object and relocate it to a custom collection\n- Generate a Geometry Nodes modifier and node tree on the default cube\n- Add and configure the Point Distribute and Point Instance nodes\n- Connect the nodes appropriately\n- Provide robust error handling and detailed print statements\n\nCRITICISM:\nThe code might be improved with additional context checks for areas in multi-editor environments. In a very large scene, additional safeguards might be warranted.

Start a new Blender project and ensure the default cube is present in the scene.\n2. Create a new Geometry Nodes modifier for the default cube.\n3. Open the Geometry Nodes workspace to allow for editing.\n4. Add a new Geometry Nodes node tree to the modifier.\n5. Create a basic setup that modifies the default cube, such as:\n   - Adding a \"Point Distribute\" node to scatter points on the surface of the cube.\n   - Adding a \"Point Instance\" node to instance a simple object (like a sphere) at the scattered points.\n6. Connect the nodes appropriately to ensure the geometry is modified and displayed correctly.\n7. Adjust parameters in the nodes to achieve a visually appealing effect, such as changing the density of the points or the scale of the instances.\n8. Ensure that the changes are visible in the viewport.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True)`, no matter what, as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\n19.

When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n29. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n30. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n42. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what,as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\n45. If you encounter `AttributeError: 'GeometryNodeObjectInfo' object has no attribute 'properties'`, do not attempt to assign an object using `object_info.properties.object`.

Use `bpy.context.temp_override(area=area, region=region)` before running the operator. For example:\n\n\nimport bpy\nimage_path = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\image_file_name.png\"\n\nfor area in bpy.context.screen.areas:\n    if area.type == \"VIEW_3D\":\n        for region in area.regions:\n            if region.type == \"WINDOW\":\n                with bpy.context.temp_override(area=area, region=region):\n                    bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add(filepath=image_path, relative_path=False, rotation=(1.31121, -2.81228e-07, 1.50394), background=True)\n                break\n        break\n\n\nInclude try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages. Avoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause. Additionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\nScripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths. Always use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`. If you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\nEnsure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\nIf you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements. Try to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing. Avoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable, within the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling. Ensure that every print statement starts with a line break character (`\\n`) to improve readability in the console. For example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\nEnsure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \n\ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n\nDo not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected. It will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\nFor example, use:\n\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n\nEnsure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\nDo not use placeholders for file paths. Always use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\n\nAvoid saving objects with modifiers to an `.obj` file, as `.obj` format does not retain Blender-specific data such as modifiers. Instead, save the object in a `.blend` file to preserve all data, including modifiers, materials, and other settings. To reuse this object in another file, use Blender's **Append** function to import it, ensuring all modifiers remain intact.\n\nIf you encounter `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the following approach:\n\n# What TO do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ndef get_active_object(context):\n    selected_objects = context.selected_objects\n    if selected_objects:\n        return context.active_object\n    return None\n\n\nAvoid using or enabling deprecated modules or add-ons, such as `io_import_scene_obj`, in Blender 4.3+. Blender now supports OBJ import natively with a built-in operator, so any code related to enabling or importing this add-on is no longer required. Use:\n\nbpy.ops.wm.obj_import(filepath=os.path.join(destination_dir, 'tree.obj'))\n\n\nEnsure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\nAlways use the `frame` keyword instead of `index` when inserting keyframes. For example:\n\nleg_bones[bone].keyframe_insert(data_path='rotation_euler', frame=frame)\n\n\nEnsure that shader types are set to a recognized string when using `gpu.shader.from_builtin`. Use only one of the following strings:\n- 'FLAT_COLOR'\n- 'IMAGE'\n- 'IMAGE_COLOR'\n- 'SMOOTH_COLOR'\n- 'UNIFORM_COLOR'\n- 'POLYLINE_FLAT_COLOR'\n- 'POLYLINE_SMOOTH_COLOR'\n- 'POLYLINE_UNIFORM_COLOR'\n\nExample usage:\n\nshader = gpu.shader.from_builtin('UNIFORM_COLOR')\n\nEnsure no deprecated types such as '2D_UNIFORM_COLOR' or '3D_UNIFORM_COLOR' are used to prevent errors in Blender 4.0+.\n\nEnsure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n=====================\nSTACK EXCHANGE LOOKUP\n=====================\n\n**Title:** How solve \"AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'ui_type'?\"\n\n**Question:**\nIn Jupyter notebook I have loaded the `bpy` module:\n\n\nimport bpy\n\n\nWith no problem. But if I load the 3D view:\n\n\nbpy.context.area.ui_type = 'VIEW_3D'\n\n\nIt gives me this error:\n\n\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'ui_type'\n\n\nHow can I solve this?\n\n**Answer:**\n`bpy` as a Python module is headless. There is no UI associated with `bpy` that is compiled as a Python module. Objects like `screen`, `area`, and `region` are part of the UI, which, being non-existent in headless mode, are given the value `None`.\n\n---\n\n**Title:** Recover Context after redraw\n\n**Question:**\nCalling `context.area.ui_type = 'IMAGE_EDITOR'` succeeds before redraw.\n\nAfter redrawing using `bpy.ops.wm.redraw_timer(type='DRAW_WIN_SWAP', iterations=1)` it fails, with the error:\n\n\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'ui_type'\n\n\nHow can I restore the context so that area is not `NoneType`?\n\n**Answer:**\nThe solution was to override the context:\n\nBlender 3.2+\n\n\nimport bpy\nfrom bpy import context\n\n# Before calling redraw, create the override dict\noverride = context.copy()\n\n# After redraw, set the area on the override instead of the context object\noverride['area'].ui_type = 'IMAGE_EDITOR'\n\n# Pass the overrides as a dictionary to the context manager\nwith context.temp_override(**override):\n    bpy.ops.image.save_as(filepath=my_filepath)\n\n\nBlender 2.8+\n\n\nimport bpy\nfrom bpy import context\n\n# Before calling redraw, create the override dict\noverride = context.copy()\n\n# After redraw, set the area on the override object\noverride['area'].ui_type = 'IMAGE_EDITOR'\n\n# Any bpy.ops.* calls must pass the override as the first argument\ne.g., bpy.ops.image.save_as(override, filepath=my_filepath)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nFixing the script to handle context issues and ensure proper node setup.\n\nREASONING:\nThe error indicates a problem with accessing the UI context, which is common when running scripts outside of Blender's interactive environment.

Always use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\n\nAvoid saving objects with modifiers to an `.obj` file, as `.obj` format does not retain Blender-specific data such as modifiers. Instead, save the object in a `.blend` file to preserve all data, including modifiers, materials, and other settings. To reuse this object in another file, use Blender's **Append** function to import it, ensuring all modifiers remain intact.\n\nIf you encounter `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the following approach:\n\n# What TO do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ndef get_active_object(context):\n    selected_objects = context.selected_objects\n    if selected_objects:\n        return context.active_object\n    return None\n\n\nAvoid using or enabling deprecated modules or add-ons, such as `io_import_scene_obj`, in Blender 4.3+. Blender now supports OBJ import natively with a built-in operator, so any code related to enabling or importing this add-on is no longer required. Use:\n\nbpy.ops.wm.obj_import(filepath=os.path.join(destination_dir, 'tree.obj'))\n\n\nEnsure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\nAlways use the `frame` keyword instead of `index` when inserting keyframes. For example:\n\nleg_bones[bone].keyframe_insert(data_path='rotation_euler', frame=frame)\n\n\nEnsure that shader types are set to a recognized string when using `gpu.shader.from_builtin`. Use only one of the following strings:\n- 'FLAT_COLOR'\n- 'IMAGE'\n- 'IMAGE_COLOR'\n- 'SMOOTH_COLOR'\n- 'UNIFORM_COLOR'\n- 'POLYLINE_FLAT_COLOR'\n- 'POLYLINE_SMOOTH_COLOR'\n- 'POLYLINE_UNIFORM_COLOR'\n\nExample usage:\n\nshader = gpu.shader.from_builtin('UNIFORM_COLOR')\n\nEnsure no deprecated types such as '2D_UNIFORM_COLOR' or '3D_UNIFORM_COLOR' are used to prevent errors in Blender 4.0+.\n\nEnsure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\nAppending current error:\nGiven the original request above, plus this error message we got after running the above code.\nFix the code and output the full code, no placeholders.\n\nWARN (bke.modifier): C:\\Users\\blender\\git\\blender-v430\\blender.git\\source\\blender\\blenkernel\\intern\\modifier.cc:424 BKE_modifier_set_error: Object: \"Cube\", Modifier: \"GeometryNodes\", Node group must have an output socket\n    \n    \ud83d\ude80 gpt_libraries: [('cv2', 'opencv-python', ''), ('ffmpeg', 'ffmpeg', ''), ('matplotlib', 'matplotlib', ''), ('PIL', 'pillow', ''), ('psutil', 'psutil', ''), ('pyautogui', 'PyAutoGUI', ''), ('pyperclip', 'pyperclip', ''), ('pywinctl', 'pywinctl', ''), ('tzdata', 'tzdata', ''), ('dateutil', 'python-dateutil', ''), ('pytz', 'pytz', ''), ('pydantic', 'pydantic', ''), ('tiktoken', 'tiktoken', ''), ('selenium', 'selenium', '4.1.0'), ('lxml', 'lxml', ''), ('plotly', 'plotly', ''), ('pygments', 'pygments', ''), ('openai', 'openai', ''), ('instructor', 'instructor', '')]\n    \ud83d\ude80 folder_path: C:\\Users\\W\\AppData\\Roaming\\Blender Foundation\\Blender\\4.3\\scripts\\addons\\blender_ai_without_errors\\lib\\Python311\\site-packages\n    \ud83d\ude80 sys.path: ['C:\\\\Users\\\\W\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Blender Foundation\\\\Blender\\\\4.3\\\\scripts\\\\addons\\\\blender_ai_without_errors\\\\lib\\\\Python311\\\\site-packages', 'C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Blender Foundation\\\\Blender 4.3\\\\4.3\\\\python\\\\lib', 'C:\\\\Users\\\\W\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Blender Foundation\\\\Blender\\\\4.3\\\\scripts\\\\addons\\\\blender_ai_without_errors\\\\lib\\\\Python311\\\\site-packages\\\\win32', 'C:\\\\Users\\\\W\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Blender Foundation\\\\Blender\\\\4.3\\\\scripts\\\\addons\\\\blender_ai_without_errors\\\\lib\\\\Python311\\\\site-packages\\\\win32', 'C:\\\\Users\\\\W\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Blender Foundation\\\\Blender\\\\4.3\\\\scripts\\\\addons\\\\blender_ai_without_errors\\\\lib\\\\Python311\\\\site-packages\\\\win32\\\\lib', 'C:\\\\Users\\\\W\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Blender Foundation\\\\Blender\\\\4.3\\\\scripts\\\\addons\\\\blender_ai_without_errors\\\\lib\\\\Python311\\\\site-packages\\\\pywin32_system32']\n    \ud83d\ude80 not_installed_libraries: [('cv2', 'opencv-python', ''), ('ffmpeg', 'ffmpeg', ''), ('matplotlib', 'matplotlib', ''), ('PIL', 'pillow', ''), ('psutil', 'psutil', ''), ('pyautogui', 'PyAutoGUI', ''), ('pyperclip', 'pyperclip', ''), ('pywinctl', 'pywinctl', ''), ('tzdata', 'tzdata', ''), ('dateutil', 'python-dateutil', ''), ('pytz', 'pytz', ''), ('pydantic', 'pydantic', ''), ('tiktoken', 'tiktoken', ''), ('selenium', 'selenium', '4.1.0'), ('lxml', 'lxml', ''), ('plotly', 'plotly', ''), ('pygments', 'pygments', ''), ('openai', 'openai', ''), ('instructor', 'instructor', '')]\n    Check GPT Test libraries function\n    *** SCRIPT STARTED ***\n    Added placeholder: UV Sphere named 'InstanceSphere' for instance object.\n    Error: An error occurred while setting up Geometry Nodes\n    *** SCRIPT COMPLETED ***\n    Read blend: \"C:\\Users\\W\\AppData\\Roaming\\Blender Foundation\\Blender\\4.3\\scripts\\addons\\blender_ai_thats_error_proof\\data\\autogpt\\workspace\\default(do not use).blend\"\n    Saved session recovery to \"C:\\Users\\W\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\quit.blend\"\n    Blender quit\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File \"C:\\Users\\W\\Documents\\FAST Settings\\AGPT-4 Script Testing\\modified_user_script.py\", line 275, in gpt_test_libraries\n        raise ImportError(\n    ImportError: The path C:\\Users\\W\\AppData\\Roaming\\Blender Foundation\\Blender\\4.3\\scripts\\addons\\blender_ai_without_errors\\lib\\Python311\\site-packages\\ffmpeg.exe does not exist or is not executable.\n      File \"C:\\Users\\W\\Documents\\FAST Settings\\AGPT-4 Script Testing\\modified_user_script.py\", line 236, in gpt_test_libraries\n        from PIL import Image\n    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PIL'\n      File \"C:\\Users\\W\\Documents\\FAST Settings\\AGPT-4 Script Testing\\modified_user_script.py\", line 285, in gpt_test_libraries\n        import pyautogui\n    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyautogui'\n      File \"C:\\Users\\W\\Documents\\FAST Settings\\AGPT-4 Script Testing\\modified_user_script.py\", line 293, in gpt_test_libraries\n        import pywinctl\n    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pywinctl'\n      File \"C:\\Users\\W\\Documents\\FAST Settings\\AGPT-4 Script Testing\\modified_user_script.py\", line 255, in gpt_test_libraries\n        import dateutil\n    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dateutil'\n      File \"C:\\Users\\W\\Documents\\FAST Settings\\AGPT-4 Script Testing\\modified_user_script.py\", line 312, in gpt_test_libraries\n        import pydantic_core  #

A new Geometry Nodes modifier with a new node group.\n\nNode groups can contain input and output sockets. The node group must have at least one output socket to function correctly. If a node group does not have an output socket, it will result in an error when the modifier is applied.\n\nWhen creating a new node group, the Group Input and Group Output nodes are automatically added to represent the data flow into and out of the group. Connections to input sockets coming from unselected nodes will become attached to the new Group Input node. Similarly, outgoing connections to input sockets of unselected nodes will become attached to the new Group Output node. If you want to pass an additional parameter into the group, a socket must be added to the Group Input node.\n\nTo do this, drag a connection from the hollow socket on the right side of the Group Input node to the desired input socket on the node requiring an input.

Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n29. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n30. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n42.

This ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n**Instruction 11:**  \nIf you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements. Try to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing. Avoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable, within the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling. Ensure that every print statement starts with a line break character (`\\n`) to improve readability in the console.\n\n- **For example:**\n  \n  print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")\n  \n\n**Instruction 12:**  \nScripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths. Always use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n\nos.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')\n\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n- `destination_image_path_png` for PNG images\n- `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images  \nThese paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n**Instruction 4:**  \nEnsure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n**Instruction 19:**  \nVertices, edges, and faces in Blender are measured from the object's origin point, initially set at the object's geometric center. For instance, the default cube has an origin point at (0, 0, 0), with a height of 2 meters. The topmost vertex starts at 1 meter in the Z direction. If the origin point is moved, the vertex, edge, and face locations still reference the origin point relative to the geometry.\n\n**Instruction 20:**  \nIn Blender, the assistant should never guess the location of vertices, edges, or faces while in edit mode. Instead, locations must always be derived programmatically by iterating over the geometry data, such as finding vertex positions dynamically using properties like coordinates (`v.co`). For example, to determine the topmost vertices of an object, calculate the maximum value for the z-coordinate and select vertices matching that value programmatically, ensuring accuracy without assumptions.\n\n**Instruction 25:**  \nAlways use the `frame` keyword instead of `index` when inserting keyframes.\n  \n- **Example:**\n  \n  leg_bones[bone].keyframe_insert(data_path='rotation_euler', frame=frame)\n  \n\n**Instruction 26:**  \nEnsure that all bone rotation modes are set to 'XYZ' Euler if using `data_path='rotation_euler'`.\n  \n- **Example:**\n  \n  # Set the rotation mode of all bones in the active object to 'XYZ' Euler\n  def set_bone_rotation_mode_to_euler():\n      rig = bpy.context.object\n      bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='POSE')\n      for bone in rig.pose.bones:\n          bone.rotation_mode = 'XYZ'\n  \n  # Ensure the active object is an armature\n  if bpy.context.object and bpy.context.object.type == 'ARMATURE':\n      set_bone_rotation_mode_to_euler()\n  \n\n**Instruction 22:**  \nFor accurate material effects in procedural creation, avoid connecting Transparent BSDF to the FAC input. Instead, use shader inputs.\n\n**Instruction 23:**  \nEnsure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n**Instruction 24:**  \nThe 'ShaderNodeTexMusgrave' node is not recognized in the current Blender API. Instead, use the 'Noise Texture' node, which includes all the same functionality. Replace Dimension input with Roughness, where \\(Roughness = Lacunarity^{-Dimension}\\), and subtract 1 from the Detail input value compared to the old Musgrave Texture node.\n\n**Instruction 27:**  \nAnimate character bones locally to ensure consistent direction of movement.\n\n**Instruction 28:**  \nIf the script interacts with Blender theme properties using a color picker, add a print statement to output the length of the theme property globally, above the main, operator/function call at bottom of script, if any, else, bottom of script.\n\n- **Example:**\n  \n  print(f\"Blender theme property color length: {len(bpy.context.preferences.themes[0].view_3d.space.gradients.high_gradient)} (Alpha present: {'Yes' if len(bpy.context.preferences.themes[0].view_3d.space.gradients.high_gradient) == 4 else 'No'})\")\n  \n\n**Instruction 31:**  \nWhen setting the 'samples' property for 'ShaderNodeAmbientOcclusion', avoid using the dictionary-style access. For example, do not do this:\n\nambient_occlusion.inputs['Samples'].default_value = 4\n\nInstead, directly set the property using the dot notation:\n\nambient_occlusion.samples = 4\n\n\n**Instruction 32:**  \nDo not use `if not bpy.data.cameras` to check for camera existence, as this only verifies if camera data exists, not if a camera is present in the scene or set as active. Instead, check if the scene has an active camera using `if bpy.context.scene.camera is None`. If no active camera is present, create one and set it as active:\n\nif bpy.context.scene.camera is None:\n    # Create a new camera if none is active\n    bpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, 0, 10))\n    bpy.context.scene.camera = bpy.context.object  # Set the newly created camera as the active camera\n    print('No active camera found; created and set a new camera as active.')\nelse:\n    print('An active camera is already set in the scene.')\n\nThis ensures the camera is correctly recognized by the render operation.\n\n**Instruction 33:**  \nThis is Blender 4.0 or newer, the `io_import_scene_obj` add-on is deprecated and removed. Do not attempt to enable or import this module. Blender now supports OBJ import natively with a built-in operator, so any code related to enabling or importing this add-on is no longer required.\n\n- **For native OBJ import, use:**\n  \n  # Example:\n  bpy.ops.wm.obj_import(filepath=os.path.join(destination_dir, 'tree.obj'))\n  \n\n**Instruction 34:**  \nEnsure that shader types are set to a recognized string when using `gpu.shader.from_builtin`. Use only one of the following strings:\n- `'FLAT_COLOR'`\n- `'IMAGE'`\n- `'IMAGE_COLOR'`\n- `'SMOOTH_COLOR'`\n- `'UNIFORM_COLOR'`\n- `'POLYLINE_FLAT_COLOR'`\n- `'POLYLINE_SMOOTH_COLOR'`\n- `'POLYLINE_UNIFORM_COLOR'`\n  \n- **Example usage:**\n  \n  shader = gpu.shader.from_builtin('UNIFORM_COLOR')\n  \n  Ensure no deprecated types such as `'2D_UNIFORM_COLOR'` or `'3D_UNIFORM_COLOR'` are used to prevent errors in Blender 4.0+.\n\n**Instruction 35:**  \nIf you get `poll() failed, context is incorrect` error when attempting to add a camera using `bpy.ops.object.camera_add`, this is likely due to Blender not being in 'OBJECT' mode when the operator is called.\n\n- **To resolve this, ensure that Blender is in 'OBJECT' mode before executing `camera_add`:**\n  \n  # Example fix for adding a camera\n  if bpy.context.mode != 'OBJECT':\n      bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')\n  bpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, -5, 2))\n  \n\n**Instruction 36:**  \nWhen adding a cloth modifier to an object, ensure that the object has at least **48 subdivisions** for realistic cloth deformation. Position the cloth object, such as a plane, **above** the target object it will interact with to enable a natural fall. Add a collision modifier to the target object (e.g., torus) so the cloth will collide with it as it falls. Use the following to add a collision modifier:\n\nbpy.ops.object.modifier_add(type='COLLISION')\n\nNote: Both cloth and collision modifiers can be found under the **Physics Properties** tab. With these settings, pressing 'play' will activate the cloth simulation, allowing the cloth to fall and interact correctly with the target.\n\n**Instruction 37:**  \nIf an object with one or more faces requires subdivision, avoid using a Subdivision modifier. Instead, enter **Edit Mode**, select all faces to subdivide, and use:\n\nbpy.ops.mesh.subdivide()\n\nIf a non-destructive subdivision is necessary, use a Subdivision modifier, but ensure the **Simplify** settings are set to match the maximum subdivision level in both **Viewport** and **Render** modes. For example, if the modifier's subdivision level is set to six, set the Simplify levels to six as well. Without matching settings, applying the modifier will produce an error.\n\n**Instruction 38:**  \nAvoid saving objects with modifiers to an `.obj` file, as `.obj` format does not retain Blender-specific data such as modifiers. Instead, save the object in a `.blend` file to preserve all data, including modifiers, materials, and other settings. To reuse this object in another file, use Blender's **Append** function to import it, ensuring all modifiers remain intact. This approach preserves the object's full configuration without needing to reapply modifiers.\n\n**Instruction 39:**  \nIf you encounter `bsdf.inputs['Subsurface'].default_value = scattering_depth`, replace it with updated code to align with Blender 4.0 API changes. Instead of using 'Subsurface', check for 'Subsurface Scale' and 'Subsurface Radius' in `bsdf.inputs`. Apply values as follows:\n\nbsdf.inputs['Subsurface Scale'].default_value = scattering_depth\nbsdf.inputs['Subsurface Radius'].default_value = (1.0, 0.2, 0.1)\n\nInclude an `else` block to print if subsurface inputs are not found.\n\n**Instruction 40:**  \nWhen writing OpenAI API Chat Completion calls, do not attempt to construct function calls using knowledge from your own memory. Instead, strictly follow this provided example:\n\n- **What NOT to do:**\n  \n  response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n      model=\"gpt-4\",\n      prompt=instruction,\n      max_tokens=100,\n      temperature=0.5\n  )\n  \n\n- **What TO do:**\n  \n  response = client.chat.completions.create(\n      model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n      messages=[\n          {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": instruction},\n          {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Script:\\n\\n{code}\"}\n      ],\n      temperature=0.2\n  )\n  \n  \nOpenAI frequently updates their API, and without an explicit API lookup system integrated, thus you cannot guarantee to the end user correct implementation for anything beyond basic Chat Completion calls, as shown in the example above.\n\n**Instruction 41:**  \nIf you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea. Because while `context.active_object` will show the currently active object, if you deselect all objects, it will still show the last active object:\n\n- **What NOT to do:**\n  \n  bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\n  grid = bpy.context.object\n  \n\n- **What TO do:**\n  \n  bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\n  def get_active_object(context):\n      selected_objects = context.selected_objects\n      if selected_objects:\n          return context.active_object\n      return None\n  \n\n**Instruction 43:**  \nIn Blender 4.3, the version we're currently in, the `scene.eevee.use_motion_blur` attribute has been deprecated and removed. Instead, you must use the updated property `scene.eevee.motion_blur_max`.\n\n- **Old Code (deprecated):**\n  \n  scene.eevee.use_motion_blur = True\n  \n\n- **New Code for Blender 4.3+:**\n  \n  scene.eevee.motion_blur_max = 32\n  \n\n**Instruction 44:**  \nIf calling `bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add` results in `RuntimeError: Operator bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add.poll() failed, context is incorrect`, ensure the correct `VIEW_3D` area and `WINDOW` region are set up before calling it.\n\n- **Just use `bpy.context.temp_override(area=area, region=region)` before running the operator:**\n  \n  import bpy\n  image_path = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\image_file_name.png\"\n  \n  for area in bpy.context.screen.areas:\n      if area.type == \"VIEW_3D\":\n          for region in area.regions:\n              if region.type == \"WINDOW\":\n                  with bpy.context.temp_override(area=area, region=region):\n                      bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add(filepath=image_path, relative_path=False, rotation=(1.31121, -2.81228e-07, 1.50394), background=True)\n                  break\n          break\n  \n\n**Instruction 17:**  \nIf attempting to enable mesh mirroring, do not use `ToolSettings` for the `use_mesh_mirror_x` attribute. In the latest version of Blender (4.3), this attribute is no longer available in `ToolSettings`. Instead, access it directly through the object's mesh data, like this:\n\nbpy.data.objects['House'].data.use_mirror_x = True\n\n\n**Instruction 18:**  \nIf attempting to use 'mesh_extrude' via ToolSettings, do not use ToolSettings for the 'mesh_extrude' attribute. In the latest version of Blender (4.3), this attribute is no longer available in ToolSettings, causing an error. Instead, achieve extrusion along normals by using the following steps:\n\nbpy.ops.mesh.extrude_region_move(TRANSFORM_OT_translate={\"orient_type\": 'NORMAL', \"orient_matrix_type\": 'NORMAL', \"constraint_axis\": (False, False, True), \"value\": (0, 0, 1)})\n\nIf you need an even offset effect, apply an inset operation after extrusion like this:\n\nbpy.ops.mesh.inset(use_even_offset=True, thickness=0.1)\n\n\n**Instruction 21:**  \nFor procedural materials, connect the Emission shader to 'Surface' on Material Output. Ensure Transparent BSDF connects only to shader inputs for accurate effects.\n\nHere's an example of how the line that received an error should be written.\nPlease fix the code using this example and return the entire fixed code,\nmeaning, return all the code you were given, with the fix applied.\n# Example of creating a Geometry Node Tree\nnode_tree = bpy.data.node_groups.new(name='GeometryNodesTree', type='GeometryNodeTree')\n\n# Check if the node tree has inputs\nif hasattr(node_tree, 'inputs'):\n    # Proceed to add inputs if they exist\n    node_tree.inputs.new('NodeSocketGeometry', 'Geometry')\nelse:\n    print(\"Node tree does not have inputs.\")"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nFixing the error related to the 'GeometryNodeTree' object not having 'inputs'.\n\nREASONING:\nThe error indicates that the 'GeometryNodeTree' object does not have an 'inputs' attribute.

Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n  \n- **Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):**\n  \n  colour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n  \n  \n- **New method in Blender 4.3+:**\n  \n  colour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n  \n  \n- **Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.**\n\n**Instruction 30:**  \nEnsure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example:\n\ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n\n**Instruction 5:**  \nInclude try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages. Avoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause. Additionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n**Instruction 2:**  \nIn Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n\n**Instruction 9:**  \nDo not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected. It will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\n- **For example, don't do this:**\n  \n  if bpy.context.object is None:\n      bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n  \n\n- **Instead, do this:**\n  \n  if not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n      bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n  \n\n**Instruction 7:**  \nAssumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n**Instruction 8:**  \nProvides full code with no placeholders.\n\n**Instruction 10:**  \nIf the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user, create the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.

Ensure that every print statement starts with a line break character (`\\n`) to improve readability in the console.\n\n- **For example:**\n  \n  print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")\n  \n\n**Instruction 12:**  \nScripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths. Always use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n\nos.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')\n\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n- `destination_image_path_png` for PNG images\n- `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images  \nThese paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n**Instruction 4:**  \nEnsure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n**Instruction 19:**  \nVertices, edges, and faces in Blender are measured from the object's origin point, initially set at the object's geometric center. For instance, the default cube has an origin point at (0, 0, 0), with a height of 2 meters. The topmost vertex starts at 1 meter in the Z direction. If the origin point is moved, the vertex, edge, and face locations still reference the origin point relative to the geometry.\n\n**Instruction 20:**  \nIn Blender, the assistant should never guess the location of vertices, edges, or faces while in edit mode.

Replace Dimension input with Roughness, where \\(Roughness = Lacunarity^{-Dimension}\\), and subtract 1 from the Detail input value compared to the old Musgrave Texture node.\n\n**Instruction 27:**  \nAnimate character bones locally to ensure consistent direction of movement.\n\n**Instruction 28:**  \nIf the script interacts with Blender theme properties using a color picker, add a print statement to output the length of the theme property globally, above the main, operator/function call at bottom of script, if any, else, bottom of script.\n\n- **Example:**\n  \n  print(f\"Blender theme property color length: {len(bpy.context.preferences.themes[0].view_3d.space.gradients.high_gradient)} (Alpha present: {'Yes' if len(bpy.context.preferences.themes[0].view_3d.space.gradients.high_gradient) == 4 else 'No'})\")\n  \n\n**Instruction 31:**  \nWhen setting the 'samples' property for 'ShaderNodeAmbientOcclusion', avoid using the dictionary-style access. For example, do not do this:\n\nambient_occlusion.inputs['Samples'].default_value = 4\n\nInstead, directly set the property using the dot notation:\n\nambient_occlusion.samples = 4\n\n\n**Instruction 32:**  \nDo not use `if not bpy.data.cameras` to check for camera existence, as this only verifies if camera data exists, not if a camera is present in the scene or set as active. Instead, check if the scene has an active camera using `if bpy.context.scene.camera is None`. If no active camera is present, create one and set it as active:\n\nif bpy.context.scene.camera is None:\n    # Create a new camera if none is active\n    bpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, 0, 10))\n    bpy.context.scene.camera = bpy.context.object  # Set the newly created camera as the active camera\n    print('No active camera found; created and set a new camera as active.')\nelse:\n    print('An active camera is already set in the scene.')\n\nThis ensures the camera is correctly recognized by the render operation.\n\n**Instruction 33:**  \nThis is Blender 4.0 or newer, the `io_import_scene_obj` add-on is deprecated and removed. Do not attempt to enable or import this module. Blender now supports OBJ import natively with a built-in operator, so any code related to enabling or importing this add-on is no longer required.\n\n- **For native OBJ import, use:**\n  \n  # Example:\n  bpy.ops.wm.obj_import(filepath=os.path.join(destination_dir, 'tree.obj'))\n  \n\n**Instruction 34:**  \nEnsure that shader types are set to a recognized string when using `gpu.shader.from_builtin`. Use only one of the following strings:\n- `'FLAT_COLOR'`\n- `'IMAGE'`\n- `'IMAGE_COLOR'`\n- `'SMOOTH_COLOR'`\n- `'UNIFORM_COLOR'`\n- `'POLYLINE_FLAT_COLOR'`\n- `'POLYLINE_SMOOTH_COLOR'`\n- `'POLYLINE_UNIFORM_COLOR'`\n  \n- **Example usage:**\n  \n  shader = gpu.shader.from_builtin('UNIFORM_COLOR')\n  \n  Ensure no deprecated types such as `'2D_UNIFORM_COLOR'` or `'3D_UNIFORM_COLOR'` are used to prevent errors in Blender 4.0+.\n\n**Instruction 35:**  \nIf you get `poll() failed, context is incorrect` error when attempting to add a camera using `bpy.ops.object.camera_add`, this is likely due to Blender not being in 'OBJECT' mode when the operator is called.\n\n- **To resolve this, ensure that Blender is in 'OBJECT' mode before executing `camera_add`:**\n  \n  # Example fix for adding a camera\n  if bpy.context.mode != 'OBJECT':\n      bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')\n  bpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, -5, 2))\n  \n\n**Instruction 36:**  \nWhen adding a cloth modifier to an object, ensure that the object has at least **48 subdivisions** for realistic cloth deformation. Position the cloth object, such as a plane, **above** the target object it will interact with to enable a natural fall. Add a collision modifier to the target object (e.g., torus) so the cloth will collide with it as it falls. Use the following to add a collision modifier:\n\nbpy.ops.object.modifier_add(type='COLLISION')\n\nNote: Both cloth and collision modifiers can be found under the **Physics Properties** tab. With these settings, pressing 'play' will activate the cloth simulation, allowing the cloth to fall and interact correctly with the target.\n\n**Instruction 37:**  \nIf an object with one or more faces requires subdivision, avoid using a Subdivision modifier. Instead, enter **Edit Mode**, select all faces to subdivide, and use:\n\nbpy.ops.mesh.subdivide()\n\nIf a non-destructive subdivision is necessary, use a Subdivision modifier, but ensure the **Simplify** settings are set to match the maximum subdivision level in both **Viewport** and **Render** modes. For example, if the modifier's subdivision level is set to six, set the Simplify levels to six as well. Without matching settings, applying the modifier will produce an error.\n\n**Instruction 38:**  \nAvoid saving objects with modifiers to an `.obj` file, as `.obj` format does not retain Blender-specific data such as modifiers. Instead, save the object in a `.blend` file to preserve all data, including modifiers, materials, and other settings. To reuse this object in another file, use Blender's **Append** function to import it, ensuring all modifiers remain intact. This approach preserves the object's full configuration without needing to reapply modifiers.\n\n**Instruction 39:**  \nIf you encounter `bsdf.inputs['Subsurface'].default_value = scattering_depth`, replace it with updated code to align with Blender 4.0 API changes. Instead of using 'Subsurface', check for 'Subsurface Scale' and 'Subsurface Radius' in `bsdf.inputs`. Apply values as follows:\n\nbsdf.inputs['Subsurface Scale'].default_value = scattering_depth\nbsdf.inputs['Subsurface Radius'].default_value = (1.0, 0.2, 0.1)\n\nInclude an `else` block to print if subsurface inputs are not found.\n\n**Instruction 40:**  \nWhen writing OpenAI API Chat Completion calls, do not attempt to construct function calls using knowledge from your own memory. Instead, strictly follow this provided example:\n\n- **What NOT to do:**\n  \n  response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n      model=\"gpt-4\",\n      prompt=instruction,\n      max_tokens=100,\n      temperature=0.5\n  )\n  \n\n- **What TO do:**\n  \n  response = client.chat.completions.create(\n      model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n      messages=[\n          {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": instruction},\n          {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Script:\\n\\n{code}\"}\n      ],\n      temperature=0.2\n  )\n  \n  \nOpenAI frequently updates their API, and without an explicit API lookup system integrated, thus you cannot guarantee to the end user correct implementation for anything beyond basic Chat Completion calls, as shown in the example above.\n\n**Instruction 41:**  \nIf you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea. Because while `context.active_object` will show the currently active object, if you deselect all objects, it will still show the last active object:\n\n- **What NOT to do:**\n  \n  bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\n  grid = bpy.context.object\n  \n\n- **What TO do:**\n  \n  bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\n  def get_active_object(context):\n      selected_objects = context.selected_objects\n      if selected_objects:\n          return context.active_object\n      return None\n  \n\n**Instruction 43:**  \nIn Blender 4.3, the version we're currently in, the `scene.eevee.use_motion_blur` attribute has been deprecated and removed. Instead, you must use the updated property `scene.eevee.motion_blur_max`.\n\n- **Old Code (deprecated):**\n  \n  scene.eevee.use_motion_blur = True\n  \n\n- **New Code for Blender 4.3+:**\n  \n  scene.eevee.motion_blur_max = 32\n  \n\n**Instruction 44:**  \nIf calling `bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add` results in `RuntimeError: Operator bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add.poll() failed, context is incorrect`, ensure the correct `VIEW_3D` area and `WINDOW` region are set up before calling it.\n\n- **Just use `bpy.context.temp_override(area=area, region=region)` before running the operator:**\n  \n  import bpy\n  image_path = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\image_file_name.png\"\n  \n  for area in bpy.context.screen.areas:\n      if area.type == \"VIEW_3D\":\n          for region in area.regions:\n              if region.type == \"WINDOW\":\n                  with bpy.context.temp_override(area=area, region=region):\n                      bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add(filepath=image_path, relative_path=False, rotation=(1.31121, -2.81228e-07, 1.50394), background=True)\n                  break\n          break\n  \n\n**Instruction 17:**  \nIf attempting to enable mesh mirroring, do not use `ToolSettings` for the `use_mesh_mirror_x` attribute. In the latest version of Blender (4.3), this attribute is no longer available in `ToolSettings`. Instead, access it directly through the object's mesh data, like this:\n\nbpy.data.objects['House'].data.use_mirror_x = True\n\n\n**Instruction 18:**  \nIf attempting to use 'mesh_extrude' via ToolSettings, do not use ToolSettings for the 'mesh_extrude' attribute. In the latest version of Blender (4.3), this attribute is no longer available in ToolSettings, causing an error. Instead, achieve extrusion along normals by using the following steps:\n\nbpy.ops.mesh.extrude_region_move(TRANSFORM_OT_translate={\"orient_type\": 'NORMAL', \"orient_matrix_type\": 'NORMAL', \"constraint_axis\": (False, False, True), \"value\": (0, 0, 1)})\n\nIf you need an even offset effect, apply an inset operation after extrusion like this:\n\nbpy.ops.mesh.inset(use_even_offset=True, thickness=0.1)\n\n\n**Instruction 21:**  \nFor procedural materials, connect the Emission shader to 'Surface' on Material Output. Ensure Transparent BSDF connects only to shader inputs for accurate effects.\n\nHere's an example of how the line that received an error should be written.\nPlease fix the code using this example and return the entire fixed code,\nmeaning, return all the code you were given, with the fix applied.\n\nAppending current error:\nGiven the original request above, plus this error message we got after running the above code.\nFix the code and output the full code, no placeholders.\n\nWARN (bke.modifier): C:\\Users\\blender\\git\\blender-v430\\blender.git\\source\\blender\\blenkernel\\intern\\modifier.cc:424 BKE_modifier_set_error: Object: \"Cube\", Modifier: \"GeometryNodes\", Node group must have a group output node\n    *** SCRIPT STARTED ***\n    Added default Cube placeholder for Geometry Nodes setup.\n    Added placeholder InstanceSphere for Geometry Nodes instancing.\n    Error: An error occurred while setting up Geometry Nodes.\n    *** SCRIPT COMPLETED ***\n    Read blend: \"C:\\Users\\W\\AppData\\Roaming\\Blender Foundation\\Blender\\4.3\\scripts\\addons\\blender_ai_thats_error_proof\\data\\autogpt\\workspace\\default(do not use).blend\"\n    Saved session recovery to \"C:\\Users\\W\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\quit.blend\"\n    \n    Blender quit\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File \"C:\\Users\\W\\Documents\\FAST Settings\\AGPT-4 Script Testing\\modified_user_script.py\", line 422, in create_geometry_nodes\n        point_distribute = nodes.new(type='GeometryNodePointDistribute')\n                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    RuntimeError: Error: Node type GeometryNodePointDistribute undefined\n\nNote: We also added the following changes to the code.\nMaintain these changes along with your fix:\n\n# To fix 'File Path' error removed error path from script:\n\n\n==========================\nBLENDER INSTRUCTION LOOKUP\n==========================\n\nHey GPT Assistant, it looks like you got an error.\n\nHere are some proven Python practices that are known to work for this type of error.\n\nMake sure to apply any and all relevant instructions to your fix.\n\nIf ever get conflicting instructions, use these instructions first, these are all tested.\n\n\n23. **Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs.

Avoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause. Additionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n**Instruction 2:**  \nIn Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n\n**Instruction 9:**  \nDo not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected. It will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\n- **For example, don't do this:**\n  \n  if bpy.context.object is None:\n      bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n  \n\n- **Instead, do this:**\n  \n  if not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n      bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n  \n\n**Instruction 7:**  \nAssumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n**Instruction 8:**  \nProvides full code with no placeholders.\n\n**Instruction 10:**  \nIf the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user, create the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user. This ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n**Instruction 11:**  \nIf you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements. Try to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing. Avoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable, within the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling. Ensure that every print statement starts with a line break character (`\\n`) to improve readability in the console.\n\n- **For example:**\n  \n  print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")\n  \n\n**Instruction 12:**  \nScripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths. Always use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n\nos.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')\n\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n- `destination_image_path_png` for PNG images\n- `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images  \nThese paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n**Instruction 4:**  \nEnsure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n**Instruction 19:**  \nVertices, edges, and faces in Blender are measured from the object's origin point, initially set at the object's geometric center. For instance, the default cube has an origin point at (0, 0, 0), with a height of 2 meters. The topmost vertex starts at 1 meter in the Z direction. If the origin point is moved, the vertex, edge, and face locations still reference the origin point relative to the geometry.\n\n**Instruction 20:**  \nIn Blender, the assistant should never guess the location of vertices, edges, or faces while in edit mode. Instead, locations must always be derived programmatically by iterating over the geometry data, such as finding vertex positions dynamically using properties like coordinates (`v.co`). For example, to determine the topmost vertices of an object, calculate the maximum value for the z-coordinate and select vertices matching that value programmatically, ensuring accuracy without assumptions.\n\n**Instruction 25:**  \nAlways use the `frame` keyword instead of `index` when inserting keyframes.\n  \n- **Example:**\n  \n  leg_bones[bone].keyframe_insert(data_path='rotation_euler', frame=frame)\n  \n\n**Instruction 26:**  \nEnsure that all bone rotation modes are set to 'XYZ' Euler if using `data_path='rotation_euler'`.\n  \n- **Example:**\n  \n  # Set the rotation mode of all bones in the active object to 'XYZ' Euler\n  def set_bone_rotation_mode_to_euler():\n      rig = bpy.context.object\n      bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='POSE')\n      for bone in rig.pose.bones:\n          bone.rotation_mode = 'XYZ'\n  \n  # Ensure the active object is an armature\n  if bpy.context.object and bpy.context.object.type == 'ARMATURE':\n      set_bone_rotation_mode_to_euler()\n  \n\n**Instruction 22:**  \nFor accurate material effects in procedural creation, avoid connecting Transparent BSDF to the FAC input. Instead, use shader inputs.\n\n**Instruction 23:**  \nEnsure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n**Instruction 24:**  \nThe 'ShaderNodeTexMusgrave' node is not recognized in the current Blender API. Instead, use the 'Noise Texture' node, which includes all the same functionality. Replace Dimension input with Roughness, where \\(Roughness = Lacunarity^{-Dimension}\\), and subtract 1 from the Detail input value compared to the old Musgrave Texture node.\n\n**Instruction 27:**  \nAnimate character bones locally to ensure consistent direction of movement.\n\n**Instruction 28:**  \nIf the script interacts with Blender theme properties using a color picker, add a print statement to output the length of the theme property globally, above the main, operator/function call at bottom of script, if any, else, bottom of script.\n\n- **Example:**\n  \n  print(f\"Blender theme property color length: {len(bpy.context.preferences.themes[0].view_3d.space.gradients.high_gradient)} (Alpha present: {'Yes' if len(bpy.context.preferences.themes[0].view_3d.space.gradients.high_gradient) == 4 else 'No'})\")\n  \n\n**Instruction 31:**  \nWhen setting the 'samples' property for 'ShaderNodeAmbientOcclusion', avoid using the dictionary-style access. For example, do not do this:\n\nambient_occlusion.inputs['Samples'].default_value = 4\n\nInstead, directly set the property using the dot notation:\n\nambient_occlusion.samples = 4\n\n\n**Instruction 32:**  \nDo not use `if not bpy.data.cameras` to check for camera existence, as this only verifies if camera data exists, not if a camera is present in the scene or set as active. Instead, check if the scene has an active camera using `if bpy.context.scene.camera is None`. If no active camera is present, create one and set it as active:\n\nif bpy.context.scene.camera is None:\n    # Create a new camera if none is active\n    bpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, 0, 10))\n    bpy.context.scene.camera = bpy.context.object  # Set the newly created camera as the active camera\n    print('No active camera found; created and set a new camera as active.')\nelse:\n    print('An active camera is already set in the scene.')\n\nThis ensures the camera is correctly recognized by the render operation.\n\n**Instruction 33:**  \nThis is Blender 4.0 or newer, the `io_import_scene_obj` add-on is deprecated and removed. Do not attempt to enable or import this module. Blender now supports OBJ import natively with a built-in operator, so any code related to enabling or importing this add-on is no longer required.\n\n- **For native OBJ import, use:**\n  \n  # Example:\n  bpy.ops.wm.obj_import(filepath=os.path.join(destination_dir, 'tree.obj'))\n  \n\n**Instruction 34:**  \nEnsure that shader types are set to a recognized string when using `gpu.shader.from_builtin`. Use only one of the following strings:\n- `'FLAT_COLOR'`\n- `'IMAGE'`\n- `'IMAGE_COLOR'`\n- `'SMOOTH_COLOR'`\n- `'UNIFORM_COLOR'`\n- `'POLYLINE_FLAT_COLOR'`\n- `'POLYLINE_SMOOTH_COLOR'`\n- `'POLYLINE_UNIFORM_COLOR'`\n  \n- **Example usage:**\n  \n  shader = gpu.shader.from_builtin('UNIFORM_COLOR')\n  \n  Ensure no deprecated types such as `'2D_UNIFORM_COLOR'` or `'3D_UNIFORM_COLOR'` are used to prevent errors in Blender 4.0+.\n\n**Instruction 35:**  \nIf you get `poll() failed, context is incorrect` error when attempting to add a camera using `bpy.ops.object.camera_add`, this is likely due to Blender not being in 'OBJECT' mode when the operator is called.\n\n- **To resolve this, ensure that Blender is in 'OBJECT' mode before executing `camera_add`:**\n  \n  # Example fix for adding a camera\n  if bpy.context.mode != 'OBJECT':\n      bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')\n  bpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, -5, 2))\n  \n\n**Instruction 36:**  \nWhen adding a cloth modifier to an object, ensure that the object has at least **48 subdivisions** for realistic cloth deformation. Position the cloth object, such as a plane, **above** the target object it will interact with to enable a natural fall. Add a collision modifier to the target object (e.g., torus) so the cloth will collide with it as it falls. Use the following to add a collision modifier:\n\nbpy.ops.object.modifier_add(type='COLLISION')\n\nNote: Both cloth and collision modifiers can be found under the **Physics Properties** tab. With these settings, pressing 'play' will activate the cloth simulation, allowing the cloth to fall and interact correctly with the target.\n\n**Instruction 37:**  \nIf an object with one or more faces requires subdivision, avoid using a Subdivision modifier. Instead, enter **Edit Mode**, select all faces to subdivide, and use:\n\nbpy.ops.mesh.subdivide()\n\nIf a non-destructive subdivision is necessary, use a Subdivision modifier, but ensure the **Simplify** settings are set to match the maximum subdivision level in both **Viewport** and **Render** modes. For example, if the modifier's subdivision level is set to six, set the Simplify levels to six as well. Without matching settings, applying the modifier will produce an error.\n\n**Instruction 38:**  \nAvoid saving objects with modifiers to an `.obj` file, as `.obj` format does not retain Blender-specific data such as modifiers. Instead, save the object in a `.blend` file to preserve all data, including modifiers, materials, and other settings. To reuse this object in another file, use Blender's **Append** function to import it, ensuring all modifiers remain intact. This approach preserves the object's full configuration without needing to reapply modifiers.\n\n**Instruction 39:**  \nIf you encounter `bsdf.inputs['Subsurface'].default_value = scattering_depth`, replace it with updated code to align with Blender 4.0 API changes. Instead of using 'Subsurface', check for 'Subsurface Scale' and 'Subsurface Radius' in `bsdf.inputs`. Apply values as follows:\n\nbsdf.inputs['Subsurface Scale'].default_value = scattering_depth\nbsdf.inputs['Subsurface Radius'].default_value = (1.0, 0.2, 0.1)\n\nInclude an `else` block to print if subsurface inputs are not found.\n\n**Instruction 40:**  \nWhen writing OpenAI API Chat Completion calls, do not attempt to construct function calls using knowledge from your own memory. Instead, strictly follow this provided example:\n\n- **What NOT to do:**\n  \n  response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n      model=\"gpt-4\",\n      prompt=instruction,\n      max_tokens=100,\n      temperature=0.5\n  )\n  \n\n- **What TO do:**\n  \n  response = client.chat.completions.create(\n      model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n      messages=[\n          {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": instruction},\n          {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Script:\\n\\n{code}\"}\n      ],\n      temperature=0.2\n  )\n  \n  \nOpenAI frequently updates their API, and without an explicit API lookup system integrated, thus you cannot guarantee to the end user correct implementation for anything beyond basic Chat Completion calls, as shown in the example above.\n\n**Instruction 41:**  \nIf you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea. Because while `context.active_object` will show the currently active object, if you deselect all objects, it will still show the last active object:\n\n- **What NOT to do:**\n  \n  bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\n  grid = bpy.context.object\n  \n\n- **What TO do:**\n  \n  bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\n  def get_active_object(context):\n      selected_objects = context.selected_objects\n      if selected_objects:\n          return context.active_object\n      return None\n  \n\n**Instruction 43:**  \nIn Blender 4.3, the version we're currently in, the `scene.eevee.use_motion_blur` attribute has been deprecated and removed. Instead, you must use the updated property `scene.eevee.motion_blur_max`.\n\n- **Old Code (deprecated):**\n  \n  scene.eevee.use_motion_blur = True\n  \n\n- **New Code for Blender 4.3+:**\n  \n  scene.eevee.motion_blur_max = 32\n  \n\n**Instruction 44:**  \nIf calling `bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add` results in `RuntimeError: Operator bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add.poll() failed, context is incorrect`, ensure the correct `VIEW_3D` area and `WINDOW` region are set up before calling it.\n\n- **Just use `bpy.context.temp_override(area=area, region=region)` before running the operator:**\n  \n  import bpy\n  image_path = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\image_file_name.png\"\n  \n  for area in bpy.context.screen.areas:\n      if area.type == \"VIEW_3D\":\n          for region in area.regions:\n              if region.type == \"WINDOW\":\n                  with bpy.context.temp_override(area=area, region=region):\n                      bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add(filepath=image_path, relative_path=False, rotation=(1.31121, -2.81228e-07, 1.50394), background=True)\n                  break\n          break\n  \n\n**Instruction 17:**  \nIf attempting to enable mesh mirroring, do not use `ToolSettings` for the `use_mesh_mirror_x` attribute. In the latest version of Blender (4.3), this attribute is no longer available in `ToolSettings`. Instead, access it directly through the object's mesh data, like this:\n\nbpy.data.objects['House'].data.use_mirror_x = True\n\n\n**Instruction 18:**  \nIf attempting to use 'mesh_extrude' via ToolSettings, do not use ToolSettings for the 'mesh_extrude' attribute. In the latest version of Blender (4.3), this attribute is no longer available in ToolSettings, causing an error. Instead, achieve extrusion along normals by using the following steps:\n\nbpy.ops.mesh.extrude_region_move(TRANSFORM_OT_translate={\"orient_type\": 'NORMAL', \"orient_matrix_type\": 'NORMAL', \"constraint_axis\": (False, False, True), \"value\": (0, 0, 1)})\n\nIf you need an even offset effect, apply an inset operation after extrusion like this:\n\nbpy.ops.mesh.inset(use_even_offset=True, thickness=0.1)\n\n\n**Instruction 21:**  \nFor procedural materials, connect the Emission shader to 'Surface' on Material Output. Ensure Transparent BSDF connects only to shader inputs for accurate effects.\n\nHere's an example of how the line that received an error should be written.\nPlease fix the code using this example and return the entire fixed code,\nmeaning, return all the code you were given, with the fix applied.\n\n==========================\nBLENDER INSTRUCTION LOOKUP\n==========================\n\nHey GPT Assistant, it looks like you got an error.\n\nHere are some proven Python practices that are known to work for this type of error.\n\nMake sure to apply any and all relevant instructions to your fix.\n\nIf ever get conflicting instructions, use these instructions first, these are all tested.\n\n\n23. **Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs.

A new Geometry Nodes modifier with a new node group.\n\nNode Group\nThe geometry node tree connected to a modifier is a Node Group. The geometry from the state before the modifier (the original geometry or the result of the previous modifier) will be passed to the Group Input node. Then the node group can operate on the geometry and pass an output to the Group Output node, where it will be passed to the next modifier.\n\nGroup Input and Output Nodes\nWhen a node group is created, new Group Input and Group Output nodes are generated to represent the data flow into and out of the group. Furthermore, connections to input sockets coming from unselected nodes will become attached to new sockets on the Group Input node. Similarly, outgoing connections to input sockets of unselected nodes will become attached to the new Group Output node.\n\nImportant Note\nFor a Geometry Node tree to function correctly, it must have at least one output socket.

But within a larger script it fails with:\n\nAttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'selected_objects' \n\nI have tried to follow the advice here: bpy.context.selected_objects by using:\n\nListObjects = [ o for o in bpy.context.scene.objects if o.select] \n\nBut that fails with:\n\nAttributeError: 'Object' object has no attribute 'select'\n  \n\nHas the o.select attribute changed in 2.80, or am I using it incorrectly? Something to do with needing to use an override, perhaps?\n\nAnswer:\nSo the thing that is you should always use context that passed by the operator instead of bpy.context. Unless you want to override context with the one you need in rare case. And Blender 2.80 does change the object.select to its private(?) value, one should consider use object.select_set(bool) and object.select_get() for select value manipulation. So assume that your function got a context passed in: ListObjects = [ o for o in context.scene.objects if o.select_get()] will give you a more reliable context."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nFixing the script to handle the AttributeError related to 'selected_objects' and ensuring the script adheres to the latest Blender API practices.\n\nREASONING:\nThe error indicates that 'selected_objects' is not available in the context.

The context you are grabbing during script execution is not necessarily the 3D View context, which you get, for instance, when you call it from the Python console. Blender\u2019s context changes depending on the situation, that\u2019s why it was given that name, I guess :) So, if you change your FOR loop to this, the script at least executes:\n\n\nfor i in range(0, max_range):\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(radius=1, location=(0, 0, 1))\n    bpy.ops.object.origin_set(type=\"ORIGIN_CURSOR\")\n    \n    # check what attributes the current context offers\n    print(dir(bpy.context))\n    # now grab a reference to the active object\n    ao = bpy.context.scene.objects.active\n    ao.scale.x = scale\n    ao.scale.y = scale\n    ao.scale.z = 5\n    bpy.ops.object.transform_apply(location=False, rotation=False, scale=True)\n    ao.location = (((i*scale*2)+(i*space))-(((max_range*scale*2)+(max_range*space)))/2, 0, 0)\n\n\nI\u2019ve added this line on purpose: `print(dir(bpy.context))` console output:\n\n\n['__doc__', '__module__', '__slots__', 'area', 'bl_rna', 'blend_data', 'copy', 'mode', 'region', 'region_data', 'rna_type', 'scene', 'screen', 'space_data', 'tool_settings', 'user_preferences', 'window', 'window_manager']\n\n\nIn the console, you can see what attributes you can access, and one of them is the current scene. So by calling the active object from there, I can access it:\n\n\nao = bpy.context.scene.objects.active\n\n\nThe problem is not solved, however. On my machine, I get 5 Objects, but only one of them contains a mesh. I can only guess what\u2019s happening; I think it is a racing condition. Since each thread calls the active object, and each one creates a new active object, one thread might 'steal' it from the other, thus affecting its location and even object data. Consider creating the objects you need directly in `bpy.data` and link them to the scene manually; this way, you get a unique reference to the object directly. You\u2019ll find guides on how to do this here on this site.

Additionally, the error regarding the `GeometryNodePointDistribute` suggests that this node type is undefined, which may indicate that the node is not available in the current context or version of Blender.\n\nHere are the relevant sections from the Blender Manual regarding Geometry Nodes and the specific nodes mentioned in your code:\n\n---\n\n### Geometry Nodes Overview\nGeometry Nodes is a system that allows for procedural geometry manipulation. It consists of a node-based interface where users can create complex geometry setups by connecting various nodes that perform specific functions.\n\n### Node Group Output\nThe first output of a node group must be a geometry type. This is crucial for the node group to function correctly within the Geometry Nodes modifier. If the output is not set to geometry, it will lead to errors when the node group is evaluated.\n\n### GeometryNodePointDistribute\nThe `GeometryNodePointDistribute` node is used to distribute points on the surface of the input geometry.

If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n29. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n30. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n42. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what,as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\n45. If you encounter `AttributeError: 'GeometryNodeObjectInfo' object has no attribute 'properties'`, do not attempt to assign an object using `object_info.properties.object`. In Blender 4.3, the correct method to set the object for an Object Info node is:\n\n# Correct way to assign the instance object:\nobject_info.inputs[0].default_value = instance_object\n\n# Do NOT use both of the following lines together:\nobject_info.inputs[0].default_value = instance_object  # \u2705 Correct\nobject_info.properties.object = instance_object  # \u274c Incorrect (causes an AttributeError)\n\nUsing both lines together is redundant and incorrect.

Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n16. Do not use `if not bpy.data.cameras` to check for camera existence, as this only verifies if camera data exists, not if a camera is present in the scene or set as active.\nInstead, check if the scene has an active camera using `if bpy.context.scene.camera is None`. If no active camera is present, create one and set it as active:\n```python\nif bpy.context.scene.camera is None:\n    # Create a new camera if none is active\n    bpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, 0, 10))\n    bpy.context.scene.camera = bpy.context.object  # Set the newly created camera as the active camera\n    print('No active camera found; created and set a new camera as active.')\nelse:\n    print('An active camera is already set in the scene.')\n```\nThis ensures the camera is correctly recognized by the render operation.\n\n17. If you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea. Because while `context.active_object` will show the currently active object, if you deselect all objects, it will still show the last active object:\n\n# What NOT to do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ngrid = bpy.context.object\n\n# What TO do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ndef get_active_object(context):\n    selected_objects = context.selected_objects\n    if selected_objects:\n        return context.active_object\n    return None\n\n18. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what,as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\n19. If calling `bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add` results in `RuntimeError: Operator bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add.poll() failed, context is incorrect`, ensure the correct `VIEW_3D` area and `WINDOW` region are set up before calling it.\n\nJust use `bpy.context.temp_override(area=area, region=region)` before running the operator.\nExample:\n```python\nimport bpy\nimage_path = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\image_file_name.png\"\n\nfor area in bpy.context.screen.areas:\n    if area.type == \"VIEW_3D\":\n        for region in area.regions:\n            if region.type == \"WINDOW\":\n                with bpy.context.temp_override(area=area, region=region):\n                    bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add(filepath=image_path, relative_path=False, rotation=(1.31121, -2.81228e-07, 1.50394), background=True)\n                break\n        break\n\n20. If you encounter `AttributeError: 'GeometryNodeObjectInfo' object has no attribute 'properties'`, do not attempt to assign an object using `object_info.properties.object`.

Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n16. Do not use `if not bpy.data.cameras` to check for camera existence, as this only verifies if camera data exists, not if a camera is present in the scene or set as active.\nInstead, check if the scene has an active camera using `if bpy.context.scene.camera is None`. If no active camera is present, create one and set it as active:\n```python\nif bpy.context.scene.camera is None:\n    # Create a new camera if none is active\n    bpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, 0, 10))\n    bpy.context.scene.camera = bpy.context.object  # Set the newly created camera as the active camera\n    print('No active camera found; created and set a new camera as active.')\nelse:\n    print('An active camera is already set in the scene.')\n```\nThis ensures the camera is correctly recognized by the render operation.\n\n17. If you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea. Because while `context.active_object` will show the currently active object, if you deselect all objects, it will still show the last active object:\n\n# What NOT to do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ngrid = bpy.context.object\n\n# What TO do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ndef get_active_object(context):\n    selected_objects = context.selected_objects\n    if selected_objects:\n        return context.active_object\n    return None\n\n18. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what,as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nI need to create a comprehensive Blender script that performs multiple tasks, including creating a Suzanne mesh, applying shaders, adding modifiers, and more.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "START OF USER REQUEST:\n\n#standard-boost\n\nCreate a Blender script that will:\n\n1. **Create a Plane**: Generate a new plane object in the scene with default dimensions.\n2. **Apply Emission Shader**: Assign an emission shader to the plane, allowing customization of color and emission strength.\n3. **Add Solidify Modifier**: Introduce a solidify modifier to the plane to add thickness, with adjustable thickness parameters.\n4. **Retopologize the Mesh**: Automatically retopologize the plane's mesh to optimize it for animation and reduce polygon count.\n5. **Create a UI Slider**: Develop a user interface slider that dynamically controls the emission strength of the shader in real-time.\n6. **Implement Geometry Nodes**: Utilize geometry nodes to procedurally manipulate the vertex positions of the plane based on a noise function, creating dynamic surface variations.\n7. **Set Up Spotlight with Volumetrics**: Configure a spotlight in the scene with volumetric lighting effects to enhance depth and atmosphere.\n8. **Animate the Plane**: Add an animation that causes the plane to oscillate or move in a fluid motion over time.\n9. **Configure Camera Movement**: Set up a camera that follows the animated plane smoothly, maintaining focus and perspective.\n10. **Optimize Rendering Settings**: Adjust rendering settings for high-quality output, including resolution, sampling, and lighting configurations suitable for a professional animation.\n\nEnsure the script is well-organized, with clear comments for each section, and includes error handling where appropriate. The final result should be a visually appealing scene demonstrating advanced Blender functionalities through Python scripting. \n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nAPPENDED USER ADDED CODE:\n\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. For procedural materials, connect the Emission shader to 'Surface' on Material Output. Ensure Transparent BSDF connects only to shader inputs for accurate effects.\n\n16. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n17. The 'ShaderNodeTexMusgrave' node is not recognized in the current Blender API. Instead, use the 'Noise Texture' node, which includes all the same functionality. Replace Dimension input with Roughness, where \\(Roughness = Lacunarity^{-Dimension}\\), and subtract 1 from the Detail input value compared to the old Musgrave Texture node.\n\n18. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n19. Do not use `if not bpy.data.cameras` to check for camera existence, as this only verifies if camera data exists, not if a camera is present in the scene or set as active.\nInstead, check if the scene has an active camera using `if bpy.context.scene.camera is None`. If no active camera is present, create one and set it as active:\n```python\nif bpy.context.scene.camera is None:\n    # Create a new camera if none is active\n    bpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, 0, 10))\n    bpy.context.scene.camera = bpy.context.object  # Set the newly created camera as the active camera\n    print('No active camera found; created and set a new camera as active.')\nelse:\n    print('An active camera is already set in the scene.')\n```\nThis ensures the camera is correctly recognized by the render operation.\n\n20. If you encounter a 'poll() failed, context is incorrect' error when attempting to add a camera using `bpy.ops.object.camera_add`,\nthis is likely due to Blender not being in 'OBJECT' mode when the operator is called.\n\nTo resolve this, ensure that Blender is in 'OBJECT' mode before executing `camera_add`. Use the following steps to safely switch modes and add the camera:\n\n# Example fix for adding a camera\nif bpy.context.mode != 'OBJECT':\n    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')\nbpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, -5, 2))\n\n21. If you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea. Because while `context.active_object` will show the currently active object, if you deselect all objects, it will still show the last active object:\n\n# What NOT to do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ngrid = bpy.context.object\n\n# What TO do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ndef get_active_object(context):\n    selected_objects = context.selected_objects\n    if selected_objects:\n        return context.active_object\n    return None\n\n22. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what,as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\n23. If you encounter `AttributeError: 'GeometryNodeObjectInfo' object has no attribute 'properties'`, do not attempt to assign an object using `object_info.properties.object`. In Blender 4.3, the correct method to set the object for an Object Info node is:\n\n# Correct way to assign the instance object:\nobject_info.inputs[0].default_value = instance_object\n\n# Do NOT use both of the following lines together:\nobject_info.inputs[0].default_value = instance_object  # \u2705 Correct\nobject_info.properties.object = instance_object  # \u274c Incorrect (causes an AttributeError)\n\nUsing both lines together is redundant and incorrect.

Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. For procedural materials, connect the Emission shader to 'Surface' on Material Output. Ensure Transparent BSDF connects only to shader inputs for accurate effects.\n\n16. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n21. When adding a cloth modifier to an object, ensure that the object has at least **48 subdivisions** for realistic cloth deformation. Position the cloth object, such as a plane, **above** the target object it will interact with to enable a natural fall. Add a collision modifier to the target object (e.g., torus) so the cloth will collide with it as it falls. Use the following to add a collision modifier: `bpy.ops.object.modifier_add(type='COLLISION')`. Note: Both cloth and collision modifiers can be found under the **Physics Properties** tab. With these settings, pressing 'play' will activate the cloth simulation, allowing the cloth to fall and interact correctly with the target.\n\n22. If you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea. Because while `context.active_object` will show the currently active object, if you deselect all objects, it will still show the last active object:\n\n# What NOT to do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ngrid = bpy.context.object\n\n# What TO do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ndef get_active_object(context):\n    selected_objects = context.selected_objects\n    if selected_objects:\n        return context.active_object\n    return None\n\n23. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what, as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nCreating a comprehensive Blender script that fulfills all the user's requirements while adhering to the extra instructions provided.\n\nREASONING:\nThe script needs to be well-structured, with functions for each task, and include error handling and comments for clarity.

It can be applied to any mesh object and is particularly useful for creating organic shapes. The modifier can be adjusted in terms of viewport and render levels, which determine how many subdivisions are applied during editing and rendering, respectively.\n\n## Properties\n- **Levels**: The number of subdivisions to apply in the viewport.\n- **Render Levels**: The number of subdivisions to apply when rendering.\n- **Quality**: Affects the quality of the subdivision, with higher values resulting in smoother surfaces but requiring more computation.\n\n## Usage\nTo add a Subdivision Surface Modifier, select the object, go to the Modifiers tab, and choose \"Add Modifier\" > \"Subdivision\". Adjust the levels as needed.\n\n# Collision Modifier\nThe Collision Modifier is used to enable collision detection for an object, allowing it to interact with other physics-enabled objects in the scene. This is essential for simulations involving cloth, soft bodies, and rigid bodies.\n\n## Properties\n- **Thickness**: The padding distance added to the inside and outside of each face to help prevent intersections.\n- **Outer**: Size of the outer collision zone.\n- **Inner**: Size of the inner collision zone (padding distance).\n- **Self Collision**: Enables the object to collide with itself, which is important for cloth simulations.\n\n## Usage\nTo add a Collision Modifier, select the object, go to the Modifiers tab, and choose \"Add Modifier\" > \"Collision\". Ensure that the object is set up correctly in the physics settings to interact with other objects.\n\nFor more detailed information, refer to the Blender Manual sections on the Subdivision Surface Modifier and Collision Modifier\u30104:1\u2020source\u3011\u30104:2\u2020source\u3011.\n\n\nUse this knowledge to familiarize yourself with the proper functions, operators, types, classes, etcetera used in Blender 4.3, while making sure to output a full script, as requested, by the user in the 'ORIGINAL REQUEST' above."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nThe errors encountered in the previous script execution need to be addressed by ensuring the correct application of modifiers and handling file paths properly.\n\nREASONING:\nThe errors were due to incorrect application of modifiers and missing HDRI file paths.

Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Always use the `frame` keyword instead of `index` when inserting keyframes.\nExample: leg_bones[bone].keyframe_insert(data_path='rotation_euler', frame=frame)\n\n16. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n17. If you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea. Because while `context.active_object` will show the currently active object, if you deselect all objects, it will still show the last active object:\n\n# What NOT to do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ngrid = bpy.context.object\n\n# What TO do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ndef get_active_object(context):\n    selected_objects = context.selected_objects\n    if selected_objects:\n        return context.active_object\n    return None\n\n18. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what,as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\n19. If calling `bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add` results in `RuntimeError: Operator bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add.poll() failed, context is incorrect`, ensure the correct `VIEW_3D` area and `WINDOW` region are set up before calling it.\n\nJust use `bpy.context.temp_override(area=area, region=region)` before running the operator.\nExample:\n```python\nimport bpy\nimage_path = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\image_file_name.png\"\n\nfor area in bpy.context.screen.areas:\n    if area.type == \"VIEW_3D\":\n        for region in area.regions:\n            if region.type == \"WINDOW\":\n                with bpy.context.temp_override(area=area, region=region):\n                    bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add(filepath=image_path, relative_path=False, rotation=(1.31121, -2.81228e-07, 1.50394), background=True)\n                break\n        break\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nI will create a Blender script that fulfills all the user's requirements, ensuring modularity, error handling, and adherence to the latest Blender standards.\n\nREASONING:\nThe script needs to be comprehensive, covering all aspects from creating a 3D text object to setting up lighting and rendering settings.

Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Always use the `frame` keyword instead of `index` when inserting keyframes.\nExample: leg_bones[bone].keyframe_insert(data_path='rotation_euler', frame=frame)\n\n17. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n18. Do not use `if not bpy.data.cameras` to check for camera existence, as this only verifies if camera data exists, not if a camera is present in the scene or set as active.\nInstead, check if the scene has an active camera using `if bpy.context.scene.camera is None`. If no active camera is present, create one and set it as active:\n```python\nif bpy.context.scene.camera is None:\n    # Create a new camera if none is active\n    bpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, 0, 10))\n    bpy.context.scene.camera = bpy.context.object  # Set the newly created camera as the active camera\n    print('No active camera found; created and set a new camera as active.')\nelse:\n    print('An active camera is already set in the scene.')\n```\nThis ensures the camera is correctly recognized by the render operation.\n\n19. If you encounter a 'poll() failed, context is incorrect' error when attempting to add a camera using `bpy.ops.object.camera_add`,\nthis is likely due to Blender not being in 'OBJECT' mode when the operator is called.\n\nTo resolve this, ensure that Blender is in 'OBJECT' mode before executing `camera_add`. Use the following steps to safely switch modes and add the camera:\n\n# Example fix for adding a camera\nif bpy.context.mode != 'OBJECT':\n    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')\nbpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, -5, 2))\n\n20. If you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea. Because while `context.active_object` will show the currently active object, if you deselect all objects, it will still show the last active object:\n\n# What NOT to do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ngrid = bpy.context.object\n\n# What TO do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ndef get_active_object(context):\n    selected_objects = context.selected_objects\n    if selected_objects:\n        return context.active_object\n    return None\n\n21. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what,as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\n22. In Blender 4.3, the version we're currently in, the `scene.eevee.use_motion_blur` attribute has been deprecated and removed.\nInstead, you must use the updated property `scene.eevee.motion_blur_max`.\n\n# Old Code (deprecated):\nscene.eevee.use_motion_blur = True\n\n# New Code for Blender 4.3+:\nscene.eevee.motion_blur_max = 32\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nI need to create a comprehensive Blender script that performs multiple tasks, including creating a monkey head, applying shaders, adding modifiers, animating the camera, and more.

Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n17. Do not use `if not bpy.data.cameras` to check for camera existence, as this only verifies if camera data exists, not if a camera is present in the scene or set as active.\nInstead, check if the scene has an active camera using `if bpy.context.scene.camera is None`. If no active camera is present, create one and set it as active:\n```python\nif bpy.context.scene.camera is None:\n    # Create a new camera if none is active\n    bpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, 0, 10))\n    bpy.context.scene.camera = bpy.context.object  # Set the newly created camera as the active camera\n    print('No active camera found; created and set a new camera as active.')\nelse:\n    print('An active camera is already set in the scene.')\n```\nThis ensures the camera is correctly recognized by the render operation.\n\n18. If you encounter a 'poll() failed, context is incorrect' error when attempting to add a camera using `bpy.ops.object.camera_add`,\nthis is likely due to Blender not being in 'OBJECT' mode when the operator is called.\n\nTo resolve this, ensure that Blender is in 'OBJECT' mode before executing `camera_add`. Use the following steps to safely switch modes and add the camera:\n\n# Example fix for adding a camera\nif bpy.context.mode != 'OBJECT':\n    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')\nbpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, -5, 2))\n\n19. If calling `bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add` results in `RuntimeError: Operator bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add.poll() failed, context is incorrect`, ensure the correct `VIEW_3D` area and `WINDOW` region are set up before calling it.\n\nJust use `bpy.context.temp_override(area=area, region=region)` before running the operator.\nExample:\n```python\nimport bpy\nimage_path = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\image_file_name.png\"\n\nfor area in bpy.context.screen.areas:\n    if area.type == \"VIEW_3D\":\n        for region in area.regions:\n            if region.type == \"WINDOW\":\n                with bpy.context.temp_override(area=area, region=region):\n                    bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add(filepath=image_path, relative_path=False, rotation=(1.31121, -2.81228e-07, 1.50394), background=True)\n                break\n        break\n\n20. If you encounter `AttributeError: 'GeometryNodeObjectInfo' object has no attribute 'properties'`, do not attempt to assign an object using `object_info.properties.object`. In Blender 4.3, the correct method to set the object for an Object Info node is:\n\n# Correct way to assign the instance object:\nobject_info.inputs[0].default_value = instance_object\n\n# Do NOT use both of the following lines together:\nobject_info.inputs[0].default_value = instance_object  # \u2705 Correct\nobject_info.properties.object = instance_object  # \u274c Incorrect (causes an AttributeError)\n\nUsing both lines together is redundant and incorrect. Only set `inputs[0].default_value` to define the object.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nCreating a comprehensive Blender script that fulfills all the user's requirements.\n\nREASONING:\nThe script needs to be structured to handle multiple tasks, including creating a circle mesh, applying shaders, adding modifiers, and setting up animations.

Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. When setting the 'samples' property for 'ShaderNodeAmbientOcclusion', avoid using the dictionary-style access. For example, do not do this:\n```\nambient_occlusion.inputs['Samples'].default_value = 4\n```\nInstead, directly set the property using the dot notation:\n```\nambient_occlusion.samples = 4\n```\n\n17. Do not use `if not bpy.data.cameras` to check for camera existence, as this only verifies if camera data exists, not if a camera is present in the scene or set as active.\nInstead, check if the scene has an active camera using `if bpy.context.scene.camera is None`. If no active camera is present, create one and set it as active:\n```python\nif bpy.context.scene.camera is None:\n    # Create a new camera if none is active\n    bpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, 0, 10))\n    bpy.context.scene.camera = bpy.context.object  # Set the newly created camera as the active camera\n    print('No active camera found; created and set a new camera as active.')\nelse:\n    print('An active camera is already set in the scene.')\n```\nThis ensures the camera is correctly recognized by the render operation.\n\n18. If you encounter a 'poll() failed, context is incorrect' error when attempting to add a camera using `bpy.ops.object.camera_add`,\nthis is likely due to Blender not being in 'OBJECT' mode when the operator is called.\n\nTo resolve this, ensure that Blender is in 'OBJECT' mode before executing `camera_add`. Use the following steps to safely switch modes and add the camera:\n\n# Example fix for adding a camera\nif bpy.context.mode != 'OBJECT':\n    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')\nbpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, -5, 2))\n\n19. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what,as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nI will create a Blender script that fulfills all the user's requirements, ensuring it is well-structured and includes error handling.

Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6.

Use only one of the following strings: 'FLAT_COLOR', 'IMAGE', 'IMAGE_COLOR', 'SMOOTH_COLOR', 'UNIFORM_COLOR', 'POLYLINE_FLAT_COLOR', 'POLYLINE_SMOOTH_COLOR', 'POLYLINE_UNIFORM_COLOR'.\n\n17. When adding a cloth modifier to an object, ensure that the object has at least **48 subdivisions** for realistic cloth deformation. Position the cloth object, such as a plane, **above** the target object it will interact with to enable a natural fall. Add a collision modifier to the target object (e.g., torus) so the cloth will collide with it as it falls. Use the following to add a collision modifier: `bpy.ops.object.modifier_add(type='COLLISION')`.\n\n18. If you encounter `bsdf.inputs['Subsurface'].default_value = scattering_depth`, replace it with updated code to align with Blender 4.0 API changes. Instead of using 'Subsurface', check for 'Subsurface Scale' and 'Subsurface Radius' in `bsdf.inputs`. Apply values as follows: `bsdf.inputs['Subsurface Scale'].default_value = scattering_depth` and `bsdf.inputs['Subsurface Radius'].default_value = (1.0, 0.2, 0.1)`. Include an `else` block to print if subsurface inputs are not found.\n\n19. In Blender 4.3, the version we're currently in, the `scene.eevee.use_motion_blur` attribute has been deprecated and removed.

Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6.

Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. When adding a cloth modifier to an object, ensure that the object has at least **48 subdivisions** for realistic cloth deformation. Position the cloth object, such as a plane, **above** the target object it will interact with to enable a natural fall. Add a collision modifier to the target object (e.g., torus) so the cloth will collide with it as it falls. Use the following to add a collision modifier: `bpy.ops.object.modifier_add(type='COLLISION')`. Note: Both cloth and collision modifiers can be found under the **Physics Properties** tab. With these settings, pressing 'play' will activate the cloth simulation, allowing the cloth to fall and interact correctly with the target.\n\n17. If you encounter a 'poll() failed, context is incorrect' error when attempting to add a camera using `bpy.ops.object.camera_add`, this is likely due to Blender not being in 'OBJECT' mode when the operator is called. To resolve this, ensure that Blender is in 'OBJECT' mode before executing `camera_add`. Use the following steps to safely switch modes and add the camera:\n\n# Example fix for adding a camera\nif bpy.context.mode != 'OBJECT':\n    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')\nbpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, -5, 2))\n\n18. Do not use `if not bpy.data.cameras` to check for camera existence, as this only verifies if camera data exists, not if a camera is present in the scene or set as active. Instead, check if the scene has an active camera using `if bpy.context.scene.camera is None`. If no active camera is present, create one and set it as active:\n```python\nif bpy.context.scene.camera is None:\n    # Create a new camera if none is active\n    bpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, 0, 10))\n    bpy.context.scene.camera = bpy.context.object  # Set the newly created camera as the active camera\n    print('No active camera found; created and set a new camera as active.')\nelse:\n    print('An active camera is already set in the scene.')\n```\nThis ensures the camera is correctly recognized by the render operation.\n\n19.

If you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea. Because while `context.active_object` will show the currently active object, if you deselect all objects, it will still show the last active object:\n\n# What NOT to do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ngrid = bpy.context.object\n\n# What TO do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ndef get_active_object(context):\n    selected_objects = context.selected_objects\n    if selected_objects:\n        return context.active_object\n    return None\n\n19.

The final setup should result in a beautiful and interactive scene that highlights advanced Blender features through automation.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nAPPENDED USER ADDED CODE:\n\n\n# These are well-tested examples of how to write specific functionality you may need.\n\nThe examples provided are pulled from a rigorously tested database, representing the definitive way to implement specific functions, properties, and operators.

Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n16. Always use the `frame` keyword instead of `index` when inserting keyframes.\nExample: leg_bones[bone].keyframe_insert(data_path='rotation_euler', frame=frame)\n\n17. Ensure that all bone rotation modes are set to 'XYZ' Euler if using 'data_path='rotation_euler'.\n   Example:\n   # Set the rotation mode of all bones in the active object to 'XYZ' Euler\n   def set_bone_rotation_mode_to_euler():\n       rig = bpy.context.object\n       bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='POSE')\n       for bone in rig.pose.bones:\n           bone.rotation_mode = 'XYZ'\n\n   # Ensure the active object is an armature\n   if bpy.context.object and bpy.context.object.type == 'ARMATURE':\n       set_bone_rotation_mode_to_euler()\n\n18. Animate character bones locally to ensure consistent direction of movement.\n\n19. Since Blender 4.0, handling node outputs has changed. Replace calls to `NodeTree.outputs` with `NodeTree.interface`.\n# Old method for creating outputs (deprecated in Blender 4.0):\ncolour_scheme.outputs.new('NodeSocketColor', mat.name)\n\n# New method in Blender 4.3+:\ncolour_scheme.interface.new_socket(name=mat.name, in_out='OUTPUT')\n# Similarly, any operations on outputs should now reference the `interface` instead of `outputs`.\n\n20. Ensure the existence of any node inputs before assigning values to them by checking the length of the `inputs` list. Example: \ntry:\n    # Ensure inputs[1] and inputs[2] exist before setting their values\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 1:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[1].default_value = 1.0\n    if len(viewer_node_3.inputs) > 2:\n        viewer_node_3.inputs[2].default_value = 1.0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred while setting viewer node inputs: {e}')\n\n21. Do not use `if not bpy.data.cameras` to check for camera existence, as this only verifies if camera data exists, not if a camera is present in the scene or set as active.\nInstead, check if the scene has an active camera using `if bpy.context.scene.camera is None`. If no active camera is present, create one and set it as active:\n```python\nif bpy.context.scene.camera is None:\n    # Create a new camera if none is active\n    bpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(0, 0, 10))\n    bpy.context.scene.camera = bpy.context.object  # Set the newly created camera as the active camera\n    print('No active camera found; created and set a new camera as active.')\nelse:\n    print('An active camera is already set in the scene.')\n```\nThis ensures the camera is correctly recognized by the render operation.\n\n22.

The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what,as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\n24. If calling `bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add` results in `RuntimeError: Operator bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add.poll() failed, context is incorrect`, ensure the correct `VIEW_3D` area and `WINDOW` region are set up before calling it.\n\nJust use `bpy.context.temp_override(area=area, region=region)` before running the operator.\nExample:\n```python\nimport bpy\nimage_path = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\image_file_name.png\"\n\nfor area in bpy.context.screen.areas:\n    if area.type == \"VIEW_3D\":\n        for region in area.regions:\n            if region.type == \"WINDOW\":\n                with bpy.context.temp_override(area=area, region=region):\n                    bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add(filepath=image_path, relative_path=False, rotation=(1.31121, -2.81228e-07, 1.50394), background=True)\n                break\n        break\n\n25. If you encounter `AttributeError: 'GeometryNodeObjectInfo' object has no attribute 'properties'`, do not attempt to assign an object using `object_info.properties.object`. In Blender 4.3, the correct method to set the object for an Object Info node is:\n\n# Correct way to assign the instance object:\nobject_info.inputs[0].default_value = instance_object\n\n# Do NOT use both of the following lines together:\nobject_info.inputs[0].default_value = instance_object  # \u2705 Correct\nobject_info.properties.object = instance_object  # \u274c Incorrect (causes an AttributeError)\n\nUsing both lines together is redundant and incorrect.

The final output should produce a visually appealing scene demonstrating the combined functionalities.\n\nEvery step of these instructions has been verified against the Blender 4.3 Manual.\n\nAPPENDED USER ADDED CODE:\n\n\nEND OF USER REQUEST\n\nFOLLOW EVERY 'EXTRA INSTRUCTION' THAT'S RELEVANT TO USER REQUEST\n\nSTART OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDo not use Blender instructions if this is simply a standard python request:\n\nDEFAULT INSTRUCTION SETS\n\n1. Provide very detailed comments explaining everything.\n\n2. In Blender 4.3+ this is the proper method to move an object from one collection to another:\n# Unlink the sphere from the scene collection first before linking to collection.\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.unlink(sphere)\n\n# Add the sphere to the collection\nmy_collection.objects.link(sphere)\n\n3. Ensure every print statement inside exception blocks contains the word 'Error' except when pertaining to object selection.\n\n4. Ensure the script uses only `with bpy.context.temp_override(**override):` for context overrides.\n\n5. Include try-except blocks for error handling with meaningful messages.\nAvoid using try-except blocks with only `pass` in the exception clause.\nAdditionally, add `traceback.print_exc()` inside the except block.\n\n6. When generating a script with a UI panel, ensure that all properties integral to the code are included in the panel's draw method.\n\n7. Assumes the Blender 4.3 environment, which was released on July 16, 2024.\n\n8. Provides full code with no placeholders.\n\n9. Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops. Instead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable,\nwithin the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n12. Scripts must be generated to avoid user interaction. Do not use placeholders for file paths.\nAlways use this verified path to avoid permission errors, unless the end user specifically requests a different path be used:\n`os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Desktop', 'AGPT-4')`.\nIf you need to supply an image path to make a script work, use the following guaranteed placeholder image paths:\n`destination_image_path_png` for PNG images and `destination_image_path_jpg` for JPG images. These paths are guaranteed to have placeholder images.\n\n13. Uses `import math` for the `radians` function if needed.\n\n14. Ensure the script uses 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT' as the ENUM value for the Eevee render engine, as this is the proper value for Blender 4.3.\n\n15. Ensure all generated code is structured into functions or appropriate operator calls. Avoid outputting bare code blocks, as these can make the script harder to follow and debug.\n\n16. Ensure that each generated script includes appropriate calls for every function and operator.\n\n15. For procedural materials, connect the Emission shader to 'Surface' on Material Output. Ensure Transparent BSDF connects only to shader inputs for accurate effects.\n\n16. Ensure every node input is appropriately connected to corresponding node outputs. Verify connections for procedural material efficiency.\n\n21. Always use the `frame` keyword instead of `index` when inserting keyframes.\nExample: leg_bones[bone].keyframe_insert(data_path='rotation_euler', frame=frame)\n\n25. If you get `AttributeError: 'Context' object has no attribute 'active_object'` when creating objects and setting them to be the active object, or if you need to make sure an object is the active object, use the below idea. Because while `context.active_object` will show the currently active object, if you deselect all objects, it will still show the last active object:\n\n# What NOT to do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ngrid = bpy.context.object\n\n# What TO do:\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_grid_add(size=10, x_subdivisions=10, y_subdivisions=10, location=(0, 0, 0))\ndef get_active_object(context):\n    selected_objects = context.selected_objects\n    if selected_objects:\n        return context.active_object\n    return None\n\n26. The person requesting this script is actively working on a scene. Do NOT include this command `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True), no matter what,as it will reset the current scene, potentially erasing unsaved work.\n\n27. If calling `bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add` results in `RuntimeError: Operator bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add.poll() failed, context is incorrect`, ensure the correct `VIEW_3D` area and `WINDOW` region are set up before calling it.\n\nJust use `bpy.context.temp_override(area=area, region=region)` before running the operator.\nExample:\n```python\nimport bpy\nimage_path = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\image_file_name.png\"\n\nfor area in bpy.context.screen.areas:\n    if area.type == \"VIEW_3D\":\n        for region in area.regions:\n            if region.type == \"WINDOW\":\n                with bpy.context.temp_override(area=area, region=region):\n                    bpy.ops.object.empty_image_add(filepath=image_path, relative_path=False, rotation=(1.31121, -2.81228e-07, 1.50394), background=True)\n                break\n        break\n\n28. If you encounter `AttributeError: 'GeometryNodeObjectInfo' object has no attribute 'properties'`, do not attempt to assign an object using `object_info.properties.object`. In Blender 4.3, the correct method to set the object for an Object Info node is:\n\n# Correct way to assign the instance object:\nobject_info.inputs[0].default_value = instance_object\n\n# Do NOT use both of the following lines together:\nobject_info.inputs[0].default_value = instance_object  # \u2705 Correct\nobject_info.properties.object = instance_object  # \u274c Incorrect (causes an AttributeError)\n\nUsing both lines together is redundant and incorrect. Only set `inputs[0].default_value` to define the object.\n\nEND OF EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS\nYou MUST respond with JSON format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nI need to create a comprehensive Blender script that performs multiple tasks, including creating a plane, applying materials, adding modifiers, and more.

Do not use `bpy.context.object` or `bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active` for testing if an object is selected.\nIt will always hold the name of the last selected object even if the object becomes unselected.\n\nFor example, don't do this:\nif bpy.context.object is None:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\nInstead, do this:\nif not bpy.context.selected_objects:\n    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1, location=(0, 0, 0))\n\n10. If the script is designed to interact with an object and a specific object name wasn't provided by the end user,\ncreate the necessary objects in the script so that no extra actions are required by the end user.\nThis ensures the script works fully without additional input from the user.\n\n11. If you encounter an error for any reason, add relevant print statements.\nTry to add a minimum of between 5 or 10 so you really know what the code's doing.\nAvoid adding print statements inside 'for' loops.\nInstead, append all data you need from inside the loop to a master variable, within the loop, and then print out the master variable, after the loop, so one can comfortably read the print statements without scrolling.\nEnsure that every print statement starts with a line break character (\\n) to improve readability in the console.\nFor example: `print(\"\\nError: Object not found\")`\n\n=====================\nBLENDER MANUAL LOOKUP\n=====================\n\nWe looked up the error in the Blender 4.3 MANUAL for you:\n\nThe error message you encountered indicates that the Boolean modifier's target object cannot be set to itself. This is a restriction in Blender to prevent circular references. The relevant section from the Blender Manual regarding the Boolean modifier is as follows:\n\n---\n\n### Boolean Modifier\n\nThe Boolean modifier allows you to perform operations on meshes using other meshes as operands. The operations available are:\n\n- **Intersect**: Keeps everything inside both the target mesh and the modified mesh.\n- **Union**: Adds the target mesh or collection to the modified mesh, removing any interior faces.\n- **Difference**: Subtracts the target mesh from the modified mesh, keeping everything outside of the target mesh.\n\n#### Operand Type\n- **Object**: The target is a mesh object.\n- **Collection**: The target is a collection. When the target is a collection and the Solver is Fast, the Intersect operation is not allowed.\n\n#### Object\n- The name of the target mesh object. **Note**: The target object cannot be the same as the object to which the modifier is applied.\n\n#### Solver\n- **Fast**: Uses a mathematically simple solver which offers the best performance; however, this solver lacks support for overlapping geometry.\n- **Exact**: Uses a mathematically complex solver which offers the best results and has full support for overlapping geometry; however, this solver is much slower than the Fast Solver.\n\n#### Solver Options\n- **Self Intersection**: Correctly calculates cases when one or both operands have self-intersections, which involves more calculations making it slower.\n\n---\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the Blender Manual\u30104:17\u2020source\u3011.\n\nUse this knowledge to familiarize yourself with the proper functions, operators, types, classes, etcetera used in Blender 4.3, while making sure to output a full script, as requested, by the user in the 'ORIGINAL REQUEST' above."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TEXT:\nThe error indicates that the Boolean modifier's target object cannot be set to itself. I need to ensure that the target object for the Boolean modifier is different from the plane. Additionally, I will incorporate the trusted file paths provided by the user.\n\nREASONING:\nBy ensuring the target object is different from the plane, I can avoid the circular reference error. I will also ensure that the script is modular and includes error handling.\n\nPLAN:\n- Fix the Boolean modifier error by ensuring the target object is different from the plane\n- Incorporate the trusted file paths\n- Ensure the script is modular and includes error handling\n\nCRITICISM:\nI need to ensure that the script is robust and handles all potential errors gracefully.
