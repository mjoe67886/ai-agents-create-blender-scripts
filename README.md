## üöÄ Repository Naming Update üöÄ  
I apologize for the mismatch between the repository name and the SEO-optimized add-on name. We will research naming options tomorrow!

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **One Quick Note**  
We're uploading everything as planned, but we've noticed something interesting during our testing. The **example pulling functionality** works **most of the time**, successfully retrieving references. However, during testing of a **basic Geometry Nodes script**, the assistant didn‚Äôt always pull the correct **Geometry Nodes code examples**.

Since part of our goal is **guiding the AI assistant to locate the correct examples**, we‚Äôre actively optimizing this process. While the **example system itself is functional**, we want to ensure it consistently finds the most relevant references.

### **Temporary Recommendation:**  
To avoid unnecessary processing costs, **we recommend avoiding Geometry Nodes script generation** if the assistant doesn't pull the correct examples.  

That said, on the **panel, there's a box displaying `.py` files**‚Äîone of them is `main_file.py`. You can **manually add small code examples** here, apart from the AI‚Äôs example pulling functionality. The system processes a **200,000-line file** to locate references, but manual input allows for more direct control.

### **Optimization in Progress:**  
- We are currently **improving the vector search functionality** to enhance retrieval accuracy.  
- In the meantime, **manually providing single code examples** (functions, operators, or small scripts) in `main_file.py` is the best approach.  
- **Keep `main_file.py` limited to one example at a time** for optimal results.  
- You can also use the **instruction set system** to fine-tune the AI‚Äôs responses.

### üé• Coming Soon: Special Section & Video Guide  
We‚Äôre going to **add a short video** explaining exactly how to use the **instruction set system** to refine the assistant‚Äôs output.  

For now, we have a **full-length tutorial video** at the bottom of the page, that includes that information toward the end, and we highly recommend watching it to fully understand how everything works. 

If you have any **questions, issues, video documentation request or feedback**, please use the **GitHub issue reporting section**‚Äîyou're helping us improve! üöÄ




### üìå FYI: Start Amassing Blender Code Examples to Get the Best Results  

Originally, this feature was part of **our main add-on, FAST Animation Studio Tools**, where it pulled examples from the biggest Blender add-on in the world. That setup made our script generator work **amazingly well** by using real Blender automation examples.

Since this **standalone version** doesn‚Äôt include our main add-on‚Äôs full codebase, it works a little differently‚Äîyou‚Äôll need to **supply your own example code or even full add-ons as examples** for the best results. Luckily, this is super easy!

---

### üß† How Our AI Generates Perfect Scripts

Our add-on uses **the same AI models as ChatGPT**, and these models generate **better scripts when given real, tested code examples**. That means the more **high-quality Blender add-ons** you provide as references, the **smarter and more accurate** your script generation will be.  

We provide a **large example file of code** with the add-on that works fine in many cases, but if a script **isn't generating correctly**, you may need to provide **relevant code examples** related to the type of script you're trying to create.


1Ô∏è‚É£ **How to Add Your Own Code Examples:**
- You can **add entire Blender add-ons** as code references by simply **adding their file paths** to a special file.
- The system will use those add-ons to generate **high-quality, error-free scripts**.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Where to Find Free Blender Add-ons:**
- **[Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/)** has **tons of free Blender add-ons** that you can use.
- You can **filter by price** to find **free** ones.
- Look for add-ons that match **the type of scripts you want to generate**.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Choosing the Right Add-ons for Best Results:**
- **Make sure the add-ons you choose are updated for Blender 4.0+** for maximum compatibility.
- If necessary, you can go down to **Blender 3.6**, but be aware that **major changes happened between 3.6 and 4.0**.
- Using outdated add-ons **may introduce issues** due to API changes.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Why This Matters:**
- **LLM that generate code perform best with real, up-to-date code.**  
- If you **don‚Äôt know how to code**, you‚Äôll get much better results by giving the system **code examples**.  
- **Note: This system uses AI to determine the perfect code examples to use so they are provided without need of user interaction.**

## Handling Errors: The Easiest Debugging System Ever

We‚Äôve made fixing errors **so simple that even a kid could do it**‚Äîseriously! üöÄ  

If the script generator encounters an error it **can‚Äôt get past**, you can resolve it in **just 5-10 minutes** using our **guided instruction system**. This means **anyone** can keep their script generator running smoothly, without needing deep programming knowledge.  

### **Pro Tip for Coders:**
If you know a function has an issue, **just throw it into the script generator**. Our AI is **explicitly instructed not to change your code structure**, so you can **trust it completely**. We regularly do this ourselves‚Äîjust let the AI handle the debugging while you focus on creating!  

üöÄ **Bottom line:** This tool is **not just about generating code**‚Äîit‚Äôs designed to keep you scripting **all the time** with **minimal effort**.  

---

## **OpenAI API Key Requirement**
To use AI features, you must enter your OpenAI API key:

1. Go to [OpenAI API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).  
2. **Log in** and retrieve your API key.  
3. **If you don‚Äôt have one**, generate a new key on that page.  
4. **Keep your API key secure**‚Äîdon‚Äôt share it publicly.  

üîπ **How the AI Works**  
- The add-on runs OpenAI models **in a loop**, perfecting code over **5 iterations by default**.  
- Each run **typically takes 1 to 5 minutes** and **costs around 30 to 50 cents**.  
- **We've implemented the GPT-03 Mini model** as a option for some of our **commonly used helper functions** that support the main AI assistant responsible for generating code.  
- **This likely reduces costs**, but we haven't fully tested it yet. If you experience issues, **switch back to GPT-4o in the settings** to ensure stability.  

üöÄ **Upcoming AI Enhancements**  
We are actively testing the **GPT-03 Mini model as an alternative for the main assistant**. In our first test, it generated **600 lines of code**, while **GPT-4o maxed out at 358 lines**. This increased output is promising, but we need further testing to ensure all **helper functions work reliably with it** before making it a selectable option.  

Our approach is to **give users flexibility**‚Äîwhenever we introduce a new model, it will be **tickable in the settings**, allowing you to **choose the AI setup that works best for your needs**. We will always keep **GPT-4o as an option** so users can revert to it at any time if they prefer.  

We are also evaluating **free AI models like DeepSeek** to see if they can match GPT-4o‚Äôs capabilities. If they perform well, we‚Äôll integrate them as an **optional setting**, providing users with additional **cost-saving choices**.  

üîπ **Our Approach to AI Optimization**  
- We‚Äôve worked extensively with **GPT-4o since launch** and optimized our workflows to **maximize its accuracy and efficiency**.  
- While some users report varied experiences with GPT-4o, **our prompting methods ensure exceptional results**.  
- We recognize that AI models can fluctuate in performance, so we are committed to **keeping previous models available as backup options**.  

üí° **What‚Äôs Next?**  
We're focused on **expanding your choices** while maintaining **high-quality script generation**. Whether that means **fully integrating GPT-03 Mini for larger outputs** or **introducing reliable free models**, our goal is to **lower costs while keeping quality high**.  

Stay tuned‚Äîthese enhancements are **on the near horizon**! üöÄ  

## **Caveat: First Release Update System Notice ‚ö†Ô∏è**  
We're pushing to get this to you **as soon as possible**, so while we **are including an add-on update system**, it **has not been fully tested yet**.  

üîπ **What to do?**  
‚úÖ **Manually check for updates** on **GitHub** until you see a console message confirming the update system is working properly, or this is removed.  


---

By default, the AI is designed to **balance quality and cost**, but if you're troubleshooting issues, switching back to **GPT-4o** is recommended for now. üöÄ  


## **Future Upgrades & Free AI Models**
We have **many upgrades planned**, and we‚Äôre prioritizing **cost reduction** for AI usage.  

- **We welcome feature requests**! We‚Äôll add the most exciting ones to our upgrade list‚Äîunless we have even bigger plans in the pipeline.  
- **The first major improvement will be testing free AI models** (like **DeepSeek** and others) to see if they can match OpenAI‚Äôs quality.  
- **Important:** We haven‚Äôt tested DeepSeek yet for this use case. **Some open-source models haven‚Äôt performed well**, so we‚Äôll carefully evaluate them before recommending any alternatives.  
- **Right now, OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o model is the best option.** However, lowering costs is a top priority, and we‚Äôll test these free models as soon as we need to update our own code.  

üì¢ **We‚Äôre busy with our main Blender add-on, but we‚Äôre committed to optimizing AI costs for users as soon as possible!**
