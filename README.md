**We ripped part of our A.I. code FAST Animation Studio Tools THE BIGGEST Blender add-on IN THE WORLD (code-wise) for your enjoyment.!**  

## Features  
- **AI-Powered Script Generation**: Uses **GPT-4o**, the same model available in ChatGPT Pro, to generate automation scripts from your detailed commands.  
- **Automatic Error Handling**: Runs the script, detects issues, and automatically fixes errors in a loop.  
- **Smart Code Lookup**: Searches the **Blender API, Blender Manual, and your own database of code examples** for solutions.  
- **Version Compatibility**: Convert older scripts to **Blender 4.3 compatibility** automatically.  
- **Boost User Command Feature**: Optimizes your input to be **Blender Manual-compatible** for better results.  
- **Cool Example System**: Can locate and retrieve example scripts from our **internal database** or even **external add-ons** you specify.  
- **Interactive Fix System**: In rare cases where auto-fix doesn‚Äôt work, an easy-to-follow instruction set system allows even **non-programmers to resolve errors in 5-10 minutes.** 
- **Hail Mary Fix Attempt**: The system performs a final attempt to **automatically solve complex issues**, so manual fixing might not be necessary.  
- **Optimized for Animation & Nodes**: Works especially well for **automation scripts, shader setups, compositor nodes, and geometry nodes.**  
- **We Love Issue Reports**: We will start fixing any issue reported **same day**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats & Important Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è  

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Repository Naming Issue**  
- **For tonight:** You must **install the add-on manually** and rename the module folder to: blender_ai_thats_error_proof

- **Fix coming early tomorrow.**  

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **First Release Update System Notice**  
- The **add-on update system is included** but **has not been fully tested yet**.  

- **Fix coming early tomorrow.**  

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Example Retrieval Optimization**  
- The system **usually** pulls correct examples, but **some Geometry Nodes scripts may not retrieve the right references**.  
- We are **improving vector search functionality** to enhance accuracy.  

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Workarounds If Needed**  
- **Manually add examples** to `main_file.py` if retrieval fails (main_file.py visible in the panel‚Äîsee tooltips).  
- **Use the user instruction set system** to refine AI responses, to help if retrieval fails.

  - **Fix coming soon on Example Puller. will start in 1 to 3 days after we upgrade the add on to MacOS**
  - 
If you have any **questions, issues, video documentation request or feedback**, We welcome you to use the **GitHub issue reporting section**üöÄ

### üöÄ How Our AI Generates Perfect Scripts

Our add-on uses **the same AI models as ChatGPT**, and these models generate **better scripts when given real, tested code examples**. That means the more **high-quality Blender add-ons** you provide as references, the **smarter and more accurate** your script generation will be.  

We provide a **large example file of code** with the add-on that works fine in many cases, but if a script **isn't generating correctly**, you may need to provide **relevant code examples** related to the type of script you're trying to create.

---
1Ô∏è‚É£ **This Add-On Comes with a Default Example File**  
- The default example file contains **almost 200,000 lines of examples**.  
- You can **remove up to 50,000 lines** and replace them with **your own code examples** while keeping the total at **200,000 lines**.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **How to Add Your Own Code Examples:**  
- You can **add entire Blender add-ons** as code references by simply **adding their file paths** to a special file.  
- The system will use those add-ons to generate **high-quality, error-free scripts**.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Where to Find Free Blender Add-ons:**  
- **[Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/)** has **tons of free Blender add-ons** that you can use.  
- You can **filter by price** to find **free** ones.  
- Look for add-ons that match **the type of scripts you want to generate**.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Choosing the Right Add-ons for Best Results:**  
- **Make sure the add-ons you choose are updated for Blender 4.0+** for maximum compatibility.  
- If necessary, you can go down to **Blender 3.6**, but be aware that **major changes happened between 3.6 and 4.0**.  
- Using outdated add-ons **may introduce issues** due to API changes.  

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Why This Matters:**  
- **LLMs that generate code perform best with real, up-to-date code.**  
- If you **don‚Äôt know how to code**, you‚Äôll get much better results by giving the system **code examples**.  
- **Note: This system uses AI to determine the perfect code examples to use, so they are provided without the need for user interaction.**

## About This Add-on  
**An AI-powered script generator with automatic error fixing‚Äîit generates, tests, and fixes Blender scripts for you.** 



## Installation  

### Windows Users  

#### 1. Download & Extract  
- **Pre-packaged with dependencies.**  
- **Double-click the ZIP file** to open it.  
- **Drag or Copy & Paste** the folder inside the ZIP to:

üöÄ **Bottom line:** This tool is **not just about generating code**‚Äîit‚Äôs designed to keep you scripting **all the time** with **minimal effort**. **It's designed for coders and non coders** alike making it so everybody can continuously generate error free code regardless.

---
üîπ **How the AI Works**  
- The add-on runs OpenAI models **in a loop**, perfecting code over **5 iterations by default**.  
- Each run **typically takes 1 to 5 minutes** and **costs around 30 to 50 cents**.  
- **We've implemented the GPT-03 Mini model** as a option for some of our **commonly used helper functions** that support the main AI assistant responsible for generating code.  
- **This likely reduces costs**, but we haven't fully tested it yet. If you experience issues, **switch back to GPT-4o in the settings** to ensure stability.  
 fluctuate in performance, so we are committed to **keeping previous models available as backup options**.
