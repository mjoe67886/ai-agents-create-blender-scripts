# AI Agents: Create Blender Scripts 🎨🖥️  
**The most powerful AI-powered Blender scripting tool.**  
# 🚨 Update (February 12, 2025)

Hey everyone, we wanted to give you a quick update. Things took a little longer than expected, so we’re pushing the full upload to **February 13, 2025**—just one more day!

The reason for this slight delay is that we're **converting one of the main features from our primary add-on into a separate add-on**. The feature itself is already well-tested and works great, but we’re now fine-tuning the surrounding functionality to ensure everything works seamlessly inside the separated add on.

We appreciate your patience and all the support! We’re really excited to share this with you **tomorrow**! 🚀🔥

## About This Add-on  
**An AI-powered script generator with automatic error fixing—it generates, tests, and fixes Blender scripts for you.**  


### **Introducing the Ultimate Script Generator for Blender 4.3**  
The latest addition to **FAST Animation Studio Tools**—which is the **BIGGEST Blender add-on IN THE WORLD (code-wise)** Provided free here for your enjoyment.!  

## Features  
- **AI-Powered Script Generation**: Uses **GPT-4o**, the same model available in ChatGPT Pro, to generate automation scripts from your detailed commands.  
- **Automatic Error Handling**: Runs the script, detects issues, and automatically fixes errors in a loop.  
- **Smart Code Lookup**: Searches the **Blender API, Blender Manual, Blender Stack Exchange, and your own database of code examples** for solutions.  
- **Version Compatibility**: Converts older scripts to **Blender 4.3 compatibility** automatically.  
- **Boost User Command Feature**: Optimizes your input to be **Blender Manual-compatible** for better results.  
- **Self-Updating Fixes**: Can locate and retrieve example scripts from our **internal database** or even **external add-ons** you specify.  
- **Interactive Fix System**: In rare cases where auto-fix doesn’t work, an easy-to-follow instruction set allows even **non-programmers to resolve errors in 5-10 minutes.**  
- **Hail Mary Fix Attempt**: The system performs a final attempt to **automatically solve complex issues**, so manual fixing might not be necessary.  
- **Optimized for Animation & Nodes**: Works especially well for **automation scripts, shader setups, compositor nodes, and geometry nodes.**  
- **World-Class Customer Support**: We will start fixing any issue reported **immediately**

## Installation  
### Windows Users  
- Pre-packaged with dependencies.  
- Install from Blender’s Preferences menu.  

### Mac & Linux Users  
- macOS verification in progress.  
- Linux support coming soon.  
- Dependencies auto-install on first run.  

## How to Use:

### 1. Enable the Add-On  
In **Blender's Preferences**, activate the add-on.

### 2. Confirm AI Features  
📢 **Check the Blender console!** The add-on will prompt you to enable AI functionality. You must confirm this prompt in the console before AI features will activate.

### 3. Open the N-Panel  
Press the `N` key in Blender to open the **N-Panel**.

### 4. Generate Scripts  
- Click **"Edit User Command"** and describe the script you need.  
- Click **"Assistant"** to generate the script.  

### 5. Enable **Verbose ToolTips**  
- This feature provides **detailed, built-in documentation** for every tooltip inside the Blender AI panels.  
- **Highly recommended**: Spend **about 30 minutes** reading through it so you understand what’s available and how features work together.  
- The add-on is designed to be user-friendly, but **reading the documentation first will ensure the best experience**.  
- If the script generator encounters an error it can't resolve, **fixing it is easy**—but you’ll want to **know how the system works**.  

---

## **OpenAI API Key Requirement**
To use AI features, you must enter your OpenAI API key:

1. Go to [OpenAI API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).  
2. **Log in** and retrieve your API key.  
3. **If you don’t have one**, generate a new key on that page.  
4. **Keep your API key secure**—don’t share it publicly.  

🔹 **How the AI Works**  
- The add-on runs OpenAI models **in a loop**, perfecting code over **5 iterations by default**.  
- Each run **typically takes 1 to 5 minutes** and **costs around 30 to 50 cents**.  
- **We've implemented the GPT-03 Mini model** as a option for some of our **commonly used helper functions** that support the main AI assistant responsible for generating code.  
- **This likely reduces costs**, but we haven't fully tested it yet. If you experience issues, **switch back to GPT-4o in the settings** to ensure stability.  

🚀 **Upcoming AI Enhancements**  
We are actively testing the **GPT-03 Mini model as an alternative for the main assistant**. In our first test, it generated **600 lines of code**, while **GPT-4o maxed out at 358 lines**. This increased output is promising, but we need further testing to ensure all **helper functions work reliably with it** before making it a selectable option.  

Our approach is to **give users flexibility**—whenever we introduce a new model, it will be **tickable in the settings**, allowing you to **choose the AI setup that works best for your needs**. We will always keep **GPT-4o as an option** so users can revert to it at any time if they prefer.  

We are also evaluating **free AI models like DeepSeek** to see if they can match GPT-4o’s capabilities. If they perform well, we’ll integrate them as an **optional setting**, providing users with additional **cost-saving choices**.  

🔹 **Our Approach to AI Optimization**  
- We’ve worked extensively with **GPT-4o since launch** and optimized our workflows to **maximize its accuracy and efficiency**.  
- While some users report varied experiences with GPT-4o, **our prompting methods ensure exceptional results**.  
- We recognize that AI models can fluctuate in performance, so we are committed to **keeping previous models available as backup options**.  

💡 **What’s Next?**  
We're focused on **expanding your choices** while maintaining **high-quality script generation**. Whether that means **fully integrating GPT-03 Mini for larger outputs** or **introducing reliable free models**, our goal is to **lower costs while keeping quality high**.  

Stay tuned—these enhancements are **on the near horizon**! 🚀  

## **Caveat: First Release Update System Notice ⚠️**  
We're pushing to get this to you **as soon as possible**, so while we **are including an add-on update system**, it **has not been fully tested yet**.  

🔹 **What to do?**  
✅ **Manually check for updates** on **GitHub** until you see a console message confirming the update system is working properly, or this is removed.  

⚠️ **Token Calculation Warning:**  
Right now, the displayed token usage **does not yet reflect the actual cost reduction when selecting the 03 Mini model**.  
- We're working on updating the token calculations, and **this update should be available tomorrow**.  
- **For now, expect some commonly used functions to cost about half as much**, while maintaining good performance.  

---

By default, the AI is designed to **balance quality and cost**, but if you're troubleshooting issues, switching back to **GPT-4o** is recommended for now. 🚀  


## **Future Upgrades & Free AI Models**
We have **many upgrades planned**, and we’re prioritizing **cost reduction** for AI usage.  

- **We welcome feature requests**! We’ll add the most exciting ones to our upgrade list—unless we have even bigger plans in the pipeline.  
- **The first major improvement will be testing free AI models** (like **DeepSeek** and others) to see if they can match OpenAI’s quality.  
- **Important:** We haven’t tested DeepSeek yet for this use case. **Some open-source models haven’t performed well**, so we’ll carefully evaluate them before recommending any alternatives.  
- **Right now, OpenAI’s GPT-4o model is the best option.** However, lowering costs is a top priority, and we’ll test these free models as soon as we need to update our own code.  

📢 **We’re busy with our main Blender add-on, but we’re committed to optimizing AI costs for users as soon as possible!**
