🟢 What Makes This Different?

Normally, generating Blender scripts with AI (like ChatGPT) can be frustrating. You have to:

❌ Manually copy errors and paste them into ChatGPT

❌ Figure out what went wrong

❌ Try multiple times to debug it

✅ Our system does all of this for you automatically!

🛠️ It tests the script

🔍 Finds errors and fixes them in a loop

📚 Uses Blender API, manual, and Stack Exchange lookups

🎯 Ensures you get a working script every time



✅ Installation Instructions


✅ Windows Users

📌 Everything is pre-packaged with dependencies

📌 Simply install the add-on from Blender’s preferences menu.


✅ Mac & Linux Users

📌 This will be verified working on MacOS this week

📌 Linux support is coming after that

📌 The LIB folder (which contains dependencies) is not included.

📌 When you first start the add-on, it will automatically install all required libraries for your system.

📌 Let the installation process complete, then start using the AI script generator!


✅ How to Use

1️⃣ Enable the Add-on in Blender’s preferences.

2️⃣ Go to the N-Panel (this is Blender's side panel, accessed by pressing N).

3️⃣ Click the "Edit User Command" button and voice-type your user command.

4️⃣ Below that, click the "Assistant" button to start the AI generating the script based on your command.

5️⃣ Click the Verbose ToolTips button on the top of the panel to enable tooltips that are fully documented.

6️⃣ Read all the tool-tips on the panel, this thing is vast...It's good for coders and non-coders alike!
