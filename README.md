## üöÄ Repository Naming IssueüöÄ  
**For tonight: You must install the add-on manually and rename the module folder to  'blender_ai_thats_error_proof' before using. We will fix having to do this early tomorrow.**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **One Quick Note**  
We're uploading everything as planned, but we've noticed something interesting during our testing. The **example pulling functionality** works **most of the time**, successfully retrieving references. However, during testing of a **basic Geometry Nodes script**, the assistant didn‚Äôt always pull the correct **Geometry Nodes code examples**.

### **Temporary Recommendation:**  
To avoid unnecessary processing costs, **we recommend avoiding Geometry Nodes script generation** if the assistant doesn't pull the correct examples.  

That said, on the **panel, there's a box displaying `.py` files**‚Äîone of them is `main_file.py`. You can **manually add small code examples** here if needed, apart from the AI‚Äôs example pulling functionality. The system processes a **200,000-line file** that we provide, to locate examples, but manual input allows for more direct control which could help here.

### **Optimization in Progress:**  
- We are currently **improving the vector search functionality** to enhance retrieval accuracy.  
- In the meantime, **manually providing single code examples** (functions, operators, or small scripts) in `main_file.py` is the best approach....(main_file.py is visible in a box on panel...read tooltips...)
- **Keep `main_file.py` limited to one example at a time** for optimal results.  
- You can also use the **instruction set system** to fine-tune the AI‚Äôs responses, and circumvent needing code examples, But this is more time consuming and only recommended to do when you have to e.g. AI system can't get past an error or example not being pulled.

### üé• Coming Soon: Special Section & Video Guide  
We‚Äôre going to **add a short video** explaining exactly how to use the **instruction set system** to refine the assistant‚Äôs output.  

For now, we have a **full-length tutorial video** at the bottom of the page, that includes that information toward the end, and we highly recommend watching it to fully understand how everything works. 

If you have any **questions, issues, video documentation request or feedback**, please use the **GitHub issue reporting section**‚Äîyou're helping us improve! üöÄ




### üìå FYI: Start Amassing Blender Code Examples to Get the Best Results  

Originally, this feature was part of **our main add-on, FAST Animation Studio Tools**, where it pulled examples from the biggest Blender add-on in the world. That setup made our script generator work **amazingly well** by using real Blender automation examples.

Since this **standalone version** doesn‚Äôt include our main add-on‚Äôs full codebase, it works a little differently‚Äîyou‚Äôll need to **supply your own example code or even full add-ons as examples** for the best results. Luckily, this is super easy!

---

### üß† How Our AI Generates Perfect Scripts

Our add-on uses **the same AI models as ChatGPT**, and these models generate **better scripts when given real, tested code examples**. That means the more **high-quality Blender add-ons** you provide as references, the **smarter and more accurate** your script generation will be.  

We provide a **large example file of code** with the add-on that works fine in many cases, but if a script **isn't generating correctly**, you may need to provide **relevant code examples** related to the type of script you're trying to create.


1Ô∏è‚É£ **How to Add Your Own Code Examples:**
- You can **add entire Blender add-ons** as code references by simply **adding their file paths** to a special file.
- The system will use those add-ons to generate **high-quality, error-free scripts**.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Where to Find Free Blender Add-ons:**
- **[Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/)** has **tons of free Blender add-ons** that you can use.
- You can **filter by price** to find **free** ones.
- Look for add-ons that match **the type of scripts you want to generate**.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Choosing the Right Add-ons for Best Results:**
- **Make sure the add-ons you choose are updated for Blender 4.0+** for maximum compatibility.
- If necessary, you can go down to **Blender 3.6**, but be aware that **major changes happened between 3.6 and 4.0**.
- Using outdated add-ons **may introduce issues** due to API changes.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Why This Matters:**
- **LLM that generate code perform best with real, up-to-date code.**  
- If you **don‚Äôt know how to code**, you‚Äôll get much better results by giving the system **code examples**.  
- **Note: This system uses AI to determine the perfect code examples to use so they are provided without need of user interaction.**

## Handling Errors well is our big selling point: It has the Easiest Debugging System Ever

We‚Äôve made fixing errors **so simple that even a kid could do it**‚Äîseriously! üöÄ  

If the script generator does encounter an error it **can‚Äôt get past**, you can resolve it in **just 5-10 minutes** using our **user instruction set system and ChatGPT Plus**. This means **anyone** can keep their script generator running smoothly, without needing deep programming knowledge.  


### **Pro Tip for Coders:**
If you know a function has an issue, **just throw it into the script generator**. Our AI is **explicitly instructed not to change your code structure**, so you can **trust it**. We regularly do this ourselves‚Äîjust let the AI handle the debugging while you focus on creating scenes!  

üöÄ **Bottom line:** This tool is **not just about generating code**‚Äîit‚Äôs designed to keep you scripting **all the time** with **minimal effort**. **It's designed for coders and non coders** alike making it so everybody can continuously generate error free code regardless.

---
üîπ **How the AI Works**  
- The add-on runs OpenAI models **in a loop**, perfecting code over **5 iterations by default**.  
- Each run **typically takes 1 to 5 minutes** and **costs around 30 to 50 cents**.  
- **We've implemented the GPT-03 Mini model** as a option for some of our **commonly used helper functions** that support the main AI assistant responsible for generating code.  
- **This likely reduces costs**, but we haven't fully tested it yet. If you experience issues, **switch back to GPT-4o in the settings** to ensure stability.  

üöÄ **Upcoming AI Enhancements**  
We are actively testing the **GPT-03 Mini model as an alternative for the main assistant**. In our first test, it generated **600 lines of code**, while **GPT-4o maxed out at 358 lines**. This increased output is promising, but we need further testing to ensure all **helper functions work reliably with it** before making it a selectable option.  

Our approach is to **give users flexibility**‚Äîwhenever we introduce a new model, it will be **tickable in the settings**, allowing you to **choose the AI setup that works best for your needs**. We will always keep **GPT-4o as an option** so users can revert to it at any time if they prefer.  

We are also evaluating **free AI models like DeepSeek and TULU 4.5B** to see if they can match GPT-4o‚Äôs capabilities. If they perform well, we‚Äôll integrate them as an **optional setting**, providing users with additional **cost-saving choices**.  

üîπ **Our Approach to AI Optimization**  
- We‚Äôve worked extensively with **GPT-4o since launch** and optimized our workflows to **maximize its accuracy and efficiency**.  
- While some users report varied experiences with GPT-4o, **We feeel it works very well & our prompting methods ensure exceptional results**.  
- We recognize that AI models can fluctuate in performance, so we are committed to **keeping previous models available as backup options**.  


## **Caveat: First Release Update System Notice ‚ö†Ô∏è**  
We're pushing to get this to you **as soon as possible**, so while we **are including an add-on update system**, it **has not been fully tested yet**.  

üîπ **What to do?**
