🚀 AI Agents: Create Blender Scripts 🎨🖥️
(Actual code coming tomorrow 2-10-2025)

🔹 This is a serious AI-powered system—20,000+ lines of seamlessly integrated code, developed over a year. 
🔹 Unlike simple repositories with a basic OpenAI request loop, this is an advanced automation tool built to, 
🔹 revolutionize Blender scripting.

🔹 We’re offering this feature for free to raise awareness of our full Blender add-on, 
🔹 ...as...we would be literally screwing 23 million Blender users if,
🔹 we don't get the word out that we sell THE Biggest Blender Add on In the World, code wise! 
🔹 And...that it removes clicks from literally every Blender process!

What Makes This Different?

Normally, generating Blender scripts with AI (like ChatGPT) can be frustrating. You have to:

Manually copy errors and paste them into ChatGPT

Figure out what went wrong

Try multiple times to debug it

✅ Our system does all of this for you automatically!

✅ It tests the script
✅ Finds errors and fixes them in a loop
✅ Uses Blender API, manual, and Stack Exchange lookups
✅ Ensures you get a working script every time

Installation Instructions

This add-on installs like any standard Blender add-on, with one key difference:

1️⃣ Windows Users

✅ Everything is pre-packaged with dependencies

Simply install the add-on from Blender’s preferences menu.

No extra steps are needed.

2️⃣ Mac & Linux Users

The LIB folder (which contains dependencies) is not included.

When you first start the add-on, it will automatically install all required libraries for your system.

Let the installation process complete, then start using the AI script generator!

How to Use

1️⃣ Enable the Add-on in Blender’s preferences.
2️⃣ Go to the N-Panel (this is Blender's side panel, accessed by pressing N).
3️⃣ Click the "Edit User Command" button and voice-type your user command.
4️⃣ Below that, click the "Assistant" button to start the AI generating the script based on your command.
5️⃣ Below that, click "Find Example" to have the system search Blender Stack Exchange for a relevant example script, fix any errors in that script, and incorporate it into your request for higher accuracy.
6️⃣ Below that, click "Question" to ask questions about Blender using:

GPT-4O model

GPT-4O Mini model

03 Mini model
7️⃣ The "Question" button can also answer questions about the add-on’s workability except for the obfuscated .pyd file, which remains proprietary.

🔹 The free version does not allow AI to access the .pyd file, ensuring our proprietary system remains protected. However, users can still inquire about the functionality of other features.

Additional Features

This add-on includes several workflow-enhancing tools, accessible through the right-click menu:
✅ Restart Blender Button (Quickly restart Blender without losing progress)
✅ Show Console Button (Brings the Blender console to the forefront for monitoring processing)
✅ Save Startup File / Delete Startup File (Manage your startup configurations with ease)
✅ Open N-Panel Button (Quickly opens the add-on panel for easy access)
✅ Auto-Update System (Notifies you of new updates at startup and allows you to install them with one click)
