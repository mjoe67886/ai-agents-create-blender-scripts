The paths to the folders inside the examples folder are auto-added to addon_paths.csv first time you click, 
'Create Add-on Examples' button (read it's tool-tip to even know what I'm taking about) on the AutoGPT panel.

Meaning this code is code that will be automatically drawn on for, 
coding examples when generating scripts with AutoGPT, if you click the above mentioned button.
