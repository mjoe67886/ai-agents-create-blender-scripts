Create a Blender script that will guide me through the process of modeling a low poly house. Here are the detailed steps I need to follow:

1. **Set Up the Scene**: Start by opening Blender and setting up a new project. Ensure that the default cube is present in the scene. If not, add a cube by using the `Add` menu or by pressing `Shift + A` and selecting `Mesh > Cube`.

2. **Create the Base of the House**: Use the default cube as the base of the house. Scale it to the desired size using the `S` key. For a low poly look, keep the scaling simple and avoid adding too many subdivisions.

3. **Add a Roof**: To create a roof, add a new mesh object, such as a cone or a pyramid. Use `Shift + A` to add a `Mesh > Cone`. Adjust the number of vertices to a low count (e.g., 4) to maintain the low poly style. Position the cone on top of the cube to form the roof.

4. **Create Windows and Doors**: Add smaller cubes to represent windows and doors. Use `Shift + A` to add `Mesh > Cube` and scale them down. Position these cubes on the walls of the house. For a low poly style, keep the shapes simple and avoid excessive detail.

5. **Join the Meshes**: Once the basic shapes are in place, join all the meshes into a single object. Select all the objects and press `Ctrl + J` to join them. This will make it easier to manage the house as a single entity.

6. **Apply Materials**: Assign basic materials to different parts of the house. Use simple colors to differentiate the roof, walls, windows, and doors. Access the materials tab in the properties panel and create new materials as needed.

7. **Adjust the Lighting**: Set up basic lighting to enhance the appearance of the house. Use a sun lamp for general lighting and adjust its position and strength to achieve the desired effect.

8. **Set Up the Camera**: Position the camera to capture the house from a flattering angle. Use the `N` panel to adjust the camera's location and rotation. Ensure the house is centered in the frame.

9. **Render the Scene**: Once everything is set up, render the scene to see the final result. Use `F12` to render the image. Adjust render settings as needed to achieve the desired quality.

10. **Save the Project**: Save the Blender project file to preserve the work. Use `File > Save As` to choose a location and file name.
